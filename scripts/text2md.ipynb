However, applying the codes can be complex, for instance:\\n\\n  * You may find code sections can be confusing or subject to interpretation.\\n  * You may encounter instances where the code does not exactly fit your design.\\n  * A code official, such as inspector or plan reviewer, may apply a code section in a manner with which you do not agree.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe information below can help you find clarity and bring resolution to your code-related issues.\\n\\n## \\n\\nCode Interpretations\\n\\n##  General Information \\n\\nIf a code section requires greater clarification, you should consider purchasing the code commentary. While not enforceable, these stand-alone publications provide the background and intent of each code section for all national codes referenced by the commonwealth of Virginia. You can purchase the commentaries at the International Code Council's online bookstore.\\n\\nThe International Code Council (ICC) also provides free code interpretations for members. For information on membership or to obtain an official code interpretation from ICC's technical staff, call at **1-888-ICC-SAFE**. ICC interpretations may be useful to support your circumstance. However, if you seek a more local interpretation, contact the following county officials:\\n\\n**Title** | **Code Enforced** | **Contact Information**  \\n---|---|---  \\nBuilding Official | Virginia Construction Code | **703-324-5175, TTY 711** | Email  \\nProperty Maintenance Official | Virginia Maintenance Code | **703-324-1300, TTY 711** |   \\nFire Marshal | Virginia Fire Code | **703-246-4800, TTY 711** | Email  \\n  \\n## \\n\\nCode Modifications\\n\\n##  General Information \\n\\nThe Fairfax County Building Official has the authority to issue a modification to a building code provision provided the proposed change meets the original's spirit and functional intent. Consider applying for a code modification if\\u2026\\n\\n  * Your project's design or construction does not meet the letter of the building code, but you feel it complies with its intent.\\n  * A code provision from an edition of the code that Virginia has yet to adopt better addresses your design or construction.\\n  * You have an alternate design, unknown method or new material that is not addressed in the code.\\n\\n\\n\\nEach modification is unique to a specific project and cannot be construed as a countywide or statewide code interpretation. A code modification is not a variance or a relaxation of a requirement; the Building Official does not have the authority to waive provisions of the code.\\n\\n##  Submission Process \\n\\nTo apply for a code modification, register for an account in PLUS. \\n\\n  1.

Please note that the \"In Review\" numbers for Residential and Commercial Building reflect the days it takes for building reviewers to complete their review, it does not include the time it takes for outside reviewers to complete their reviews.\n\nApplications go through Application Submittal Review for completeness and sufficiency within\u00ad two business days of the submission date. If an application is deemed complete, it moves to the next step of the workflow, typically the technical review. The review process is subject to the completeness of an application, whether additional rounds of reviews are needed, and the applicant\u2019s response to staff comments. Please view these current metrics for additional information. You will be able to see the status of your application when you log into your PLUS account and check **processing status** under the **Record Info** tab.\n\nIf the current task has not been completed within the timeframe shown in the metrics below, please contact us at **703-222-0801, TTY 711**.\n\n_**Residential Permits.

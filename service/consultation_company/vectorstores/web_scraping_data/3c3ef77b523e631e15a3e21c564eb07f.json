While a public hearing is not required, during the meeting, the item is described to the Board as a whole and a decision is made by motion. Please be aware that during the review of such requests, staff will coordinate with you to assure that you provide all required legal notification and coordination with the appropriate member of the Board of Supervisors. Generally, the process requires submission of documents that describe the request (with any necessary supporting graphics), and affidavit. For any questions related to minor variations, please contact the Planner of the Day at (703) 324-1290.\n\n## HOW TO SUBMIT A REQUEST\n\nAll requests for a minor variation must be submitted electronically through the PLUS application portal.\n\nFor additional information on how to use the PLUS application portal, please visit the DPD PLUS Information & Support page. Instructional videos are available on the Fairfax County PLUS - YouTube channel.\n\nIf you have technical questions (e.g. account setup, password issues) regarding the PLUS system, please contact the Help Desk:\n\n  * Hours of Operation: Mon. - Fri., 8 a.m. - 4 p.m.\n  * PLUSSupport@FairfaxCounty.gov | 703-324-2222, TTY 711\n\n\n\nLaunch PLUS\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nGuidelines for submitting a request for a minor variation are as follows:\n\nThe Zoning Ordinance provides that the Board may approve certain requests for minor variations without a public hearing so long as such requests do not materially affect proffered conditions of use, density or intensity for the following types of requests. Please see subsection 8100.5.A(2) for the exact language.\n\n  1. Add or modify a use, so long as the use is not specifically precluded in the proffers and it is demonstrated that the new use would have no materially greater land use impacts than the approved uses;\n  2. Increase the permitted building height 15 feet or 15%, whichever is less so long as the maximum height for the zoning district is not exceeded;\n  3. Modify minimum setbacks or other dimensions;\n  4. Add, modify or delete active or passive recreation uses in certain circumstances after the recreational facility was built;\n  5. Modify proffer commitments related to technologies or services that are underutilized, ineffective or obsolete;\n  6. Modify architectural design, character, color, features or materials for buildings and signs in certain circumstances.\n\n\n\n## Submission Requirements\n\nIf interested in filing for a minor variation, please submit the following documentation in the PLUS application portal to the Zoning Evaluation Division: \n\n  1. Fee of $610; to be paid through the PLUS application portal;\n  2. A letter describing your request;\n  3. Notarized property owner authorization (if the property owner has an agent or is not the applicant); \n  4. Graphics (if appropriate) which depict the proposed variation;\n  5. Signed minor variation statement describing the specific proffer change requested; \n  6. Completed rezoning affidavit; and\n  7. Copy of zoning map with the subject property outlined in red.\n\n\n\nUpon submission of a complete package, staff will review and schedule the application for a Board of Supervisors meeting with a target of around 60 days after submission. Should any changes or modifications to your information be needed, staff will contact you. Please be aware that, should the district Supervisor determine that a public hearing would be more appropriate for your request, staff will contact you to determine the next steps. Finally, approximately 30 days prior to your Board meeting, you will receive the notifications, with instructions, that you will mail out to certain adjoining property owners. \n\n## \n\nMINOR VARIATIONS LISTING\n\n##  2024 \n\n#### BOS Meeting Date: 09/10/2024\n\nRecord Number | Applicant | Related Zoning Case | Affidavit | Statement | Board Item  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nMVR-2024-PR-00002 | Westpark Corporate Center Rooftop Amenity Space | RZ-2020-PR-008 | 8/21/2024 | 6/17/2024 | 9/10/2024  \n  \n##  Previous Years \n\n#### BOS Meeting Date: 05/18/2021\n\nApplicant | Related Zoning Case | Affidavit | Statement | Board Item  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nWest Springfield Center, LLC  | RZ 76-S-021 | 05/04/2021 | See Board Item | 05/18/2021  \n  \n#### BOS Meeting Date: 09/24/2019\n\nApplicant | Related Zoning Case | Affidavit | Statement | Board Item  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nFairfax County Board of Supervisors | PCA 2003-MV-033 | 09/13/2019 | See Board Item | 09/24/2019  \n  \n#### BOS Meeting Date: 06/25/2019\n\nApplicant | Related Zoning Case | Affidavit | Statement | Board Item  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nLidl US Operations, LLC | PCA/GDPA 95-Y-016-05 | 04/22/2019 | 06/07/2019 | 06/25/2019  \n  \n#### BOS Meeting Date: 05/07/2019\n\nApplicant | Related Zoning Case | Affidavit | Statement | Board Item  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nFrontier Drive Metro Center, L.P. | RZ 93-L-023 | 03/22/2019 | See Board Item | 05/07/2019  \n  \n#### BOS Meeting Date: 01/22/2019\n\nApplicant | Related Zoning Case | Affidavit | Statement | Board Item  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nFairfax County Redevelopment and Housing Authority | PCA 89-A-001-02 | 01/03/2019 | See Board Item | 01/22/2019  \n  \n#### BOS Meeting Date: 11/20/2018\n\nApplicant | Related Zoning Case | Affidavit | Statement | Board Item  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nVirendra Bery, Surendra Berry, Sashi Berry | RZ 1997-BR-025 | 11/08/2018 | See Board Item | 11/20/2018  \n  \n#### BOS Meeting Date: 10/16/2018\n\nApplicant | Related Zoning Case | Affidavit | Statement | Board Item  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nSpringfield Commons, LLC | RZ 1996-LE-047 | 09/12/2018 | See Board Item | 10/16/2018  \nWashREIT Riverside Apartments, LLC | RZ 2016-MV-030 | 09/25/2018 | See Board Item | 10/16/2018  \n  \n#### BOS Meeting Date: 07/31/2018\n\nApplicant | Related Zoning Case | Affidavit | Statement | Board Item  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nEvergreene Companies, LLC | RZ 2003-LE-055 | 07/12/2018 | See Board Item | 07/31/2018  \nMidland Road, LLC | RZ 2005-SP-019 | 07/11/2018 | 07/11/2018 | 07/31/2018  \n  \n#### BOS Meeting Date: 04/10/2018\n\nApplicant | Related Zoning Case | Affidavit | Statement | Board Item  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nArtis Senior Living of Fairfax Station, LLC | RZ 2016-MV-011 | 03/23/2018 | See Board Item | 04/10/2018  \n  \n#### BOS Meeting Date: 03/06/2018\n\nApplicant | Related Zoning Case | Affidavit | Statement | Board Item  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCommonwealth Regency | PCA 2006-SU-025-02 | 02/23/2018 | See Board Item | 03/06/2018  \nGS Ashton, LLC | PCA 86-C-029-10 | 02/13/2018 | See Board Item | 03/06/2018\n",

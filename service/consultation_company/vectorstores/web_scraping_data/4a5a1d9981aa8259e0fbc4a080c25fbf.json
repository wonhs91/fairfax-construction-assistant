Life safety and required code items cannot be separated out and inspected later. When applying, include the room/areas that are ready to be finalized in the description of work. Building and trade separation permits must be obtained prior to calling for final inspection.\n\nSeparation Permits cannot be used to \u201cPhase\u201d construction. Phasing should be determined prior to submission of the original application. If phasing a project is something that comes into play during the review process or after permit issuance, please reach out the Permit Application Center for assistance at LDSBuildingPermits@fairfaxcounty.gov. Please do not apply for a Separation record unless necessary.  \n\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## WHO SHOULD APPLY?\n\nProperty owners may obtain permits in their own name, however, it is strongly recommended a properly licensed contractor pull the permits as the responsible party so the county can better assist in gaining compliance for defective work.\n\n## PLAN AHEAD\n\nBefore submitting, ensure you are aware of all applicable regulations and conditions that could affect your project to avoid surprises during the review process.

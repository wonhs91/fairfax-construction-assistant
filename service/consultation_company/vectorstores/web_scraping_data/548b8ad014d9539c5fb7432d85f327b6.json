STLs are typically advertised on Airbnb, VRBO and FlipKey, etc. STLs are permitted as an accessory use in most zoning districts that permit residential uses, and in all types of dwellings i.e. single-family homes, townhouses, condos, manufactured homes and apartments. In order to use any part of a residence as an STL location, Fairfax County requires that the owner or tenant obtain a permit and meet certain criteria prior to commencing STL operation.\n\n## HOW TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION\n\nAll short-term lodging applications must be submitted electronically through the PLUS application portal.\n\nFor additional information on how to use the PLUS application portal, please visit the DPD PLUS Information & Support page.

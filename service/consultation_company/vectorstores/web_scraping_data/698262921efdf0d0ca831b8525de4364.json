The Fairfax County Special Inspections Program (SIP), established in 1973 after the collapse of a 26-story concrete building under construction, monitors all major commercial and residential construction projects.\n\nSpecial inspections are observations, inspections and tests conducted during the construction of a building which require particular expertise to substantiate adequacy. The owner must retain a Registered Design Professional to provide these services, and bears the associated costs.\n\n_**Note:** A pre-construction meeting and a critical structures meeting are the same thing and referred to as both in the program manual, Web page and in PLUS._\n\nSpecial inspections Program Publication 2021 \n\nSpecial inspections Program Publication 2018 \n\n## Special Inspection Meeting with Critical Structures Section\n\n**Before requesting a pre-construction meeting** , create a CRIT record and link it to the associated building record if it is subject to the SIP.

These living spaces include areas for eating, sleeping, living, and sanitation. Accessory living units within the principal dwelling (not in a detached structure) and that meet all of the applicable standards, including access and entrances, size, and parking, may apply for approval through an administrative permit. Otherwise, an accessory living unit requires submission of an application for a special permit, which requires approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals. ALUs that were previously approved by special permit can be renewed through the PLUS system by requesting a Time Extension of Approved Zoning Cases.\n\n## HOW TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION\n\nAll accessory living unit (administrative permit) applications must be submitted electronically through the PLUS application portal.\n\nFor additional information on how to use the PLUS application portal, please visit the DPD PLUS Information & Support page. Instructional videos are available on the Fairfax County PLUS - YouTube channel.\n\nIf you have technical questions (e.g. account setup, password issues) regarding the PLUS system, please contact the Help Desk:\n\n  * Hours of Operation: Mon. - Fri., 8 a.m. - 4 p.m.\n  * PLUSSupport@FairfaxCounty.gov | 703-324-2222, TTY 711\n\n\n\nLaunch PLUS\n\n## Additional Information\n\n  * An application for an accessory living unit may take approximately 30 calendar days to process. If a building permit is required to establish the ALU, the administrative permit will be reviewed and if approvable, will be held in a waiting status until the associated building permit has received final inspection. \n  * The application fee is $235. The fee for a renewal is $80. Fees are paid electronically at the end of the application submission process. A service charge of 2.35% will be added to all fees paid with a credit card.\n  * Additional processes and approvals, such as the need for a building permit, may be identified and required during the administrative permit review process. Additional requirements may include, but are not limited to: \n    * Installation of an interconnected fire alarm system. When a stove, oven, or range is located in the ALU, the 2018 Building Code requires fire-rated floor and wall assemblies between a principal unit and an ALU or an interconnected fire alarm system with third-party monitoring. Please see the link below for information on how to apply for a fire alarm system certification. All ALUs require a working multi-purpose fire extinguisher and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors (when required for a fireplace or gas service) that are interconnected with the principal dwelling. \n    * Permits for proposed construction or to bring an existing space into compliance, such as a permit for a stove or other cooking appliance, creation of an emergency egress point for a bedroom, or an electrical permit for previous unpermitted work.\n    * If on well or septic, additional documentation may be required by the Health Department to accommodate any additional bedrooms.\n\n\n\n## Required Documents\n\n**Property Plan:** A plat showing the location of the dwelling. The plat must demonstrate that a total of three parking spaces are provided if the dwelling is located on a public street, and a total of four parking spaces are provided if located on a private street.

If the dwelling is served by a well or septic system, the applicant must obtain Health Department approval prior to administrative permit or special permit approval. \n\n(11) The accessory living unit must have a working multi-purpose fire extinguisher and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors (when required for a fireplace or gas service) that are interconnected with the principal dwelling. \n\n(12) Before occupancy of the accessory living unit, the owner must record a copy of the administrative permit among the land records of Fairfax County. The permit must contain a description of the property and must be indexed in the Grantor Index in the name of the property owner(s). \n\n(13) An administrative permit for an accessory living unit may be issued to the owner for an initial period of two years from the date of approval. An administrative permit may be extended by the Zoning Administrator for succeeding periods of up to five years based on the applicant\u2019s record of compliance with the standards in this subsection. \n\n(14) If the standards above are no longer being met, the accessory living unit may not be occupied as a dwelling unit and the property must meet the occupancy limitations of a single-family dwelling in accordance with subsection 4102.3.A. This standard does not require the removal of any kitchen or other facilities. \n\n**Standards when permitted by special permit:**\n\n(15) The accessory living unit must conform to all applicable standards for an administrative permit above, except that the BZA may approve a special permit for an accessory living unit to modify one or more of the standards as identified in the subsections below: \n\n(a) Subsection (2), to permit an accessory living unit in a freestanding structure, but only on a lot of at least two acres; \n\n(b) Subsection (3), to modify the location of any external entrance and access from the street; \n\n(c) Subsection (4)(a), to exceed the maximum size for an interior accessory living unit; and \n\n(d) Subsection (9), when the required on-site parking is not provided. \n\n(16) The area devoted to a detached accessory living unit must not exceed 1,200 square feet of gross floor area and must be clearly subordinate to the principal dwelling. \n\n(17) The BZA may require the provision of off-street parking spaces in addition to the requirements specified in Article 6 for a single-family detached dwelling. \n\n(18) The County may inspect the property during reasonable hours and in accordance with subsection 8106.2.D. \n\n(19) Upon the approval of a special permit, the owner will record a copy of the BZA\u2019s resolution of approval, including all accompanying conditions among the land records of Fairfax County. The resolution must contain a description of the property and must be indexed in the Grantor Index in the name of the property owner(s). \n\n(20) A special permit for an accessory living unit may only be issued to the owner and approved for an initial period of two years from the date of approval. The special permit may be extended for succeeding periods of up to five years based on the applicant\u2019s record of compliance, in accordance with subsection 8100.4.D(3).\n\n##  4102.1.I - Standards for Administrative Permit Approvals \n\n(1) The County may inspect the property during reasonable hours and in accordance with subsection 8106.2.D.\n\n(2) The Zoning Administrator may revoke an administrative permit at any time if the owner or operator of the use fails to comply with all requirements of the law with respect to maintenance and conduct of the use and all conditions imposed by the Zoning Administrator in connection with the permit.\n\n(3) The Zoning Administrator will issue a notice of revocation to the owner or operator, hand-delivered or mailed, return receipt requested, setting forth the grounds upon which the permit was revoked, the date and time the revocation took effect, and describing the appeals procedure.

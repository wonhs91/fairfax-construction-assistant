The record plat must be accompanied by a deed prepared in a form acceptable to the county attorney. Record plats are typically required for subdivisions of land, dedications of rights-of-way or easements for utilities and uses and the vacation of floodplain and storm drainage easements. For the dedication or vacation of public easements, not including floodplain and storm drainage easements, see the Easement Plat (EP) record type.\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## **WHO SHOULD APPLY?**\n\nProperty owners or their duly authorized agents may submit record plats, however, the plat itself must be certified by a professional engineer or land surveyor licensed by the Commonwealth of Virginia and meeting the respective code requirements.\n\n  * Verify License on DPOR Website\n  * Hiring a Contractor\n\n\n\n## **PLAN AHEAD**\n\nBefore submitting, ensure you are aware of all applicable regulations and conditions that could affect your project to avoid surprises during the review process.

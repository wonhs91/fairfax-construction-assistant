Examples of home-based businesses include home offices, music lessons, art studios, home crafts, and home-based food production. A home-based business does not include any other accessory use defined in the Zoning Ordinance, such as a home day care facility or short-term lodging. In addition, teleworking is not a home-based business.\n\nA list of the permitted home-based businesses and additional information can be found below and in subsection 4102.7.H of the Zoning Ordinance.\n\n## HOW TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION\n\nAll home-based business applications must be submitted electronically through the PLUS application portal.\n\nFor additional information on how to use the PLUS application portal, please visit the DPD PLUS Information & Support page.

All home-based businesses that involve the production of approved foods must submit a Home-Based Food Production Supplemental Form. \n  * Certain small-scale production uses (including home-based food production) taking place on a property served by a septic system may require additional information or a wastewater characterization study. Please contact the Health Department at 703-246-2201 or hdehd@fairfaxcounty.gov prior to applying for a home-based business permit for information on what may be required.\n  * A limited riding or boarding stable is not considered a home-based business.

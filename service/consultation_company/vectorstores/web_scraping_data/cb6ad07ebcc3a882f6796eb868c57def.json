Recognizing the critical importance to protect, preserve and restore these beneficial environmental assets, Fairfax County government and other state and federal agencies have adopted laws and regulations to preserve the quality of our waterways by preventing erosion, protecting shorelines, reducing pollution, and preserving vegetation.

The Wetlands Board reviews and approves permits that impact lands contiguous to a tidal body of water and lying between mean low water and mean high water, and are subject to flooding by normal tides and wind tides. Meeting information including schedule, agenda, and minutes are available by following the link below.\n\nView Wetlands Board Meeting Information\n\n## Environmental Stewardship & Permitting Information\n\nSo what does this mean to tidal shoreline property owners who want to make changes to their property? It means that depending on the type, size and location of the project, you will probably need one or more permits and other approvals from the respective federal, state or local agencies. This is because the various regulations apply differently based on the nature and scope of the project and its proximity to certain environmental features.\n\n## Where is the Project Located?\n\nBefore any construction on the shoreline or water\u2019s edge begins, permits and approvals from the respective federal, state or local agencies will likely be required. The number and type of necessary permits and approvals will vary depending on the type, size and location of the project. You may obtain permits in your own name, however, it is strongly recommended the contractor performing the work obtain the permit in their name. Also, make certain the contractor you choose is properly licensed with the state and the county.\n\n_**Click for larger view**_  \n\n\n## What Permits Are Required?\n\nInformation on permits that are required, such as Wetlands permits, flood plain, and Resource Protection Area (RPA)...\n\n  * Learn More\n\n\n\n## How to Apply for a Wetlands Permit\n\nThe Wetlands Board\u2019s application process has three requirements...\n\n  * Learn More\n\n\n\n## Glossary\n\nA Glossary of Terms related to Tidal Wetlands and Shorelines in Fairfax County, VA.\n\n  * View Glossary\n\n\n",

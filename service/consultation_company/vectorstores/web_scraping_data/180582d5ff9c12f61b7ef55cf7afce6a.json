Higher insulation R-values are permitted provided their dimensions properly fit in the intended cavity without compacting its thickness. Glazing with lower U-factors than required are also permitted. \n\nInsulation Installation Tips\n\n**Minimum R-Values for Walls/Floors/Ceilings**\n\n**Element** |  **New Home, Addition** |  **Sunroom**  \n---|---|---  \nCeilings |  382 |  19  \nWalls (wood framed) |  15 |  13  \nWalls (concrete, CMU) |  8/133 |  8/133  \nFloors |  19 |  19  \nBasement Walls |  10/134 |  10/134  \nSlab-on-grade5 |  10 |  10  \nCrawl Space Walls6 |  10/132 |  10/132  \n  \n**Maximum U-Factors for Glazing**\n\n**Element** |  **New Home, Addition** |  **Sunroom**  \n---|---|---  \nWindow1 |  0.35 |  0.45  \nDoors1 |  0.35 |  0.45  \nSkylights1 |  0.35 |  0.70  \n  \n1 Windows, doors and skylights shall have a maximum solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of 0.40.  \n2 R-30 can be substituted for R-38 with a raised heel or energy truss where the full height of the insulation is maintained over the entire ceiling footprint and the exterior wall. See figure below.\n\n3 Use R-8 when insulation is applied to the exterior; use R-13 when insulation is applied on the interior.  \n4 Use R-10 when applied continuously against the wall; use R-13 when applied between studs or furring strips.  \n5 Insulation must extend from the slab edge to a length of 24 inches vertically and/or horizontally; see figure below.\n\n6 Use insulation on crawl space walls in unvented-conditioned crawl spaces with no floor insulation above.\n\n## Determining your own R-values and U-factors?\n\nIf you wish to use R-values and U-factors other than those prescribed above, you may manually design your house, addition or sunroom using RESCheck from the U.S. Department of Energy. Learn more. \n\n## How do I show compliance on the plans?\n\nClearly indicate on your construction drawings the required R-values and U-factors from the table above or from your RESCheck computation. Upload the RESCheck Compliance Certificate with your construction plans when used.\n\n  \nNeed Help? Call **703-222-0801** , **TTY 711**.\n\nMonday through Thursday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Friday from 9:15 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n  * LDS Permit Library: Access guides to navigate every record type in PLUS.\n  * Letters to Industry: Subscribe for LDS announcements, notices, and tech bulletins.\n  * Meet With Staff: Find a staff member to help you with the permit process.\n\n\n",

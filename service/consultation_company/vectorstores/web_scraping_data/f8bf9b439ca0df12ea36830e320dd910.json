Masterfile approval does not constitute permission to build. Once your Masterfile is approved you must apply for an individual building permit to use the approved plans for construction. \n\nMasterfiles are approved for each model type. They should have the same base foundation and options like a sunroom or rear extension. Masterfiles with multiple base foundations are not permitted and should be submitted separately.\n\nSite-related plans and a first-off building permit application are no longer required to submit for a Masterfile.\n\nGenerally, the Masterfile program is used for new residential construction (Single Family Detached and Attached) but there are some commercial projects that qualify.\n\nFor information regarding the process to obtain a residential building permit, please reference the appropriate residential building record type webpage. For questions related to commercial projects, please contact the Permit Application Center at LDSBuildingPermits@fairfaxcounty.gov or by calling 703-222-0801, TTY 711.\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## WHO SHOULD APPLY?\n\nProperty owners may obtain permits in their own name, however, it is strongly recommended a properly licensed contractor pull the permits as the responsible party so the county can better assist in gaining compliance for defective work.\n\n## PLAN AHEAD\n\nBefore submitting, ensure you are aware of all applicable regulations and conditions that could affect your project to avoid surprises during the review process.

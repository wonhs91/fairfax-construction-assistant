To begin the Bond Application process please go to the PLUS - Accela Citizen Access Link and create a Bond Application under the **\u201cSite\u201d Tab** in PLUS. Please upload all the applicable documents, signature authority, agreements, etc. to the **\u201cDocuments\u201d Tab**. All fees can be paid online under your **\u201cDashboard\u201d Tab** in your shopping cart in PLUS.\n\n## Life of a Bond\n\nThe bond is active over the life of the project and will be returned to the developer, or \u201creleased,\u201d when the public improvements have been satisfactorily completed.\n\n  * Bond Estimate Review\n  * Bond and Permit Package Approval | Common Bond Errors\n  * Bond Alterations\n  * Bond Release | Common Bond Release Errors\n\n\n\n## Alterations to a Bond\n\nIf the project runs out of time, an \u201cextension\u201d may be requested.

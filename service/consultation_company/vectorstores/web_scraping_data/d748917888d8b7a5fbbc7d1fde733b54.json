The amendment requests originate from the Board of Supervisors, Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, citizens, industry representatives, and county staff. In addition to the Work Program, the Priority 2 list consists of those amendment requests that will be reviewed for future inclusion on the Work Program.\n\nThe Zoning Ordinance Work Program for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 was endorsed on July 30, 2024, for a two-year cycle. Recognizing that Zoning Ordinance amendments often require more than one year to complete, including research and community outreach, the ZOWP is presented for a two-year cycle with annual updates to ensure that the Work Program continues to reflect the Board\u2019s priorities.\n\nInformation regarding the Work Program and the Priority 2 list can be found below:\n\n## \n\nZOWP\n\n##  2024 \n\nFY 2025-2026 Adopted Work Program\n\nFY 2025-2026 Adopted Priority 2 Work Program\n\nMemorandum to Board of Supervisors Land Use Policy Committee\n\nEstimated Timelines\n\n##  2023 \n\nFY 2024-2025 Adopted Work Program\n\nFY 2024-2025 Adopted Priority 2 Work Program\n\nMemorandum to Board of Supervisors Land Use Policy Committee\n\nEstimated Timelines\n\nReport to Board of Supervisors on Accessory Living Units and Home-Based Businesses (Work Program Item #1A)\n\n##  2022 \n\nFY 2023-2024 Adopted Work Program\n\nFY 2023-2024 Adopted Priority 2 Work Program\n\nMemorandum to Board of Supervisors Land Use Policy Committee\n\nEstimated Timelines\n\nReport to Board of Supervisors on Accessory Living Units and Home-Based Businesses (Work Program Item #12B)\n\nReport to Board of Supervisors on Agritourism and Related Changes\n\n##  2021 \n\nFY 2022-2023 Adopted Work Program\n\nFY 2022-2023 Adopted Priority 2 Work Program\n\nEstimated Timelines\n\n##  2020 \n\n2020 Adopted Work Program\n\n2020 Adopted Priority 2 Work Program\n",

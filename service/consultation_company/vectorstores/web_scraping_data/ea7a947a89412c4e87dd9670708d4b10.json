Sections of the Comprehensive Plan are updated periodically to incorporate Plan amendments adopted by the Board of Supervisors. This page contains the current and historic documents of the 2017 Edition of the Comprehensive Plan. The \"Amended Through [date]\" in each section header of The Plan, identifies when that section was last updated. For editions of the Plan prior to 2017 (dating back to 1984), visit the Historic Comprehensive Plan Documents webpage.\n\n*Denotes the current Comprehensive Plan\n\n**Click on a section below to

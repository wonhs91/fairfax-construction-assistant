To improve efficiency, Fairfax County conducts combination inspections, where all related inspections for a project\u2014such as concealment and final inspections\u2014must be scheduled on the same day. Failing to bundle inspections properly may result in a failed inspection and a reinspection fee. Scheduling inspections at key stages of the project helps ensure safety and compliance.\n\nSchedule, Change or Cancel an Inspection in PLUS\n\n_**Remember:** To request an inspection for the next business day, you must submit your request in PLUS prior to 11:59 p.m. If the inspection is scheduled without the work being complete, it could result in a reinspection fee._\n\nAll inspection notifications will be sent to the applicant and the onsite contact(s). An email is sent the morning of a scheduled inspection identifying a two hour window of arrival, the inspector's name and phone number. The results will be sent to the same contact(s) after the inspection has been conducted.\n\n_**Note:** Inspectors cannot take a call while driving or during an inspection, so please leave a message and your inspector will call you back._\n\n**Watch Video for Instructions on Scheduling an Inspection in PLUS:**\n\n## VIRTUAL INSPECTIONS\n\nFairfax County building inspections are operating by virtual and in-person inspections.

This would include but would not be limited to land records, financial documents for mortgages, leases, loans, trusts and wills, as appropriate.\n\n\n\n##  How do I change the name of a subdivision? \n\n  * There are no statutes or ordinances regulating changing a subdivision\u2019s name on an entrance sign. If a subdivision would like to change the name on its entrance sign, the subdivision should check with FAC staff to ensure that the proposed new subdivision name is not already in use. If the name is available, the subdivision must obtain any applicable permits to change the sign.\n  * If the community would like to legally document the subdivision name change in the land records and erase the current name from its chain of title and history, the property owners\u2019 association or authorized entity representing the subdivision must submit a deed of correction, with any properly authorized signature, to Land Development Services to change the name on the original subdivision plat. A new subdivision plat of correction would not be required to simply change the subdivision name.\n  * In instances when there is no homeowners\u2019 association, or entrance signs are on private owner\u2019s property, the community would need to explore private legal counsel on how to properly gain community support for the subdivision name change on the entrance sign and the private lot owner\u2019s separate agreement to change the sign on that owner\u2019s private property.\n\n\n\n## Need More Information?\n\nFor questions or additional information, please contact the Bonds and Addressing Center staff via email at LDSBAC@fairfaxcounty.gov or by phone **703-222-0801, TTY 711**.\n\n  \n\n\nCustomer Record Submission Process - Address Change - Journey Map 1.84 MB\n\nCustomer Record Submission Process - Street Name Change - Journey Map 1.4 MB\n\n  \nNeed Help?

The requirements and procedures for geotechnical investigations are found in the Public Facilities Manual Chapter 4. Procedures for minor projects, such as small residential additions, sheds, retaining walls, etc., are discussed on the Soil Requirements for Minor Construction Projects webpage. Approval of a geotechnical report may be required prior to approval of a site-related plan for development.  \n\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## **WHO SHOULD APPLY?**\n\nProperty owners or their duly authorized agents may submit geotechnical reports, however, the planning of soils exploration, sampling and testing programs, and close supervision of the work must be performed by a geotechnical engineer who has experience in this type of work and who is licensed by the Commonwealth of Virginia and meeting the respective code requirements.

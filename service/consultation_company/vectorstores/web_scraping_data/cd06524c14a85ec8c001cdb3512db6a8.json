As part of the submission of a special exception, special permit, development plan, or rezoning application. A sports illumination plan is subject to approval by either the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) in conjunction with a special permit or the Board of Supervisors (Board) in conjunction with a special exception, development plan, or proffered rezoning. A sports illumination plan approved by the BZA or Board must be submitted as part of a site plan submission for the use. Upon a written request with justification, the Zoning Administrator may modify a submission requirement of (3) below if it is determined that the requirement is not necessary for an adequate review of the sports illumination plan.\n  2. For a facility that is permitted by right in the zoning district in which it is located, as part of the site plan submission, or as a separate submission when site plan approval is not required. Upon a written request with justification, the Director of Land Development Services (Director) may modify a submission requirement of (3) below if it is determined that the requirement is not necessary for an adequate review of the sports illumination plan. Such sports illumination plan is subject to review and approval by the Director.\n\n\n\n**A sports illumination plan must contain the following:**\n\n  1. The boundaries, dimensions, and total land area of the property at a designated scale of not less than 1\" = 50'. For proposed uses on large tracts of land where the lighted playing field or court occupies a small portion of the site, the boundaries, dimensions and total land area of just the lighted playing field or court with perimeter areas, must be provided, at a designated scale of not less than 1\" = 50', with a graphic that depicts the location of the fields and courts in relation to the perimeter lot lines of the entire property.\n  2. Location and limits of playing fields and courts, to include a perimeter area which must be located entirely on the same lot. For baseball and softball fields, the perimeter area extends 40 feet in a direction perpendicular to the foul lines and away from the field. The perimeter area for rectangular playing fields, such as soccer, football, lacrosse, and field hockey, extends 20 feet from the side lines and 30 feet from the end lines. The perimeter area for tee boxes on golf courses and golf driving ranges is 30 feet. The perimeter area for all other playing fields and courts extends ten feet beyond the playing field or court boundary.\n  3. Location, height, and illustration of each style of all pole, building, and ground-mounted lighting fixtures for the playing field or court.\n  4. A photometric diagram showing predicted maintained lighting levels for the proposed playing field or court and associated perimeter area lighting.\n\n\n\n**Submissions:**\n\n  * In addition to meeting the above referenced requirements, your plan must meet the lighting standards outlined under subsection 5109B(4) of the Zoning Ordinance.\n  * Review fee\n\n\n\nHelpful Videos:\n\n****Respond to Issues - YouTube\n\n****Upload Corrected Plans - YouTube\n\nHelpful Instruction Guides:\n\n  * Corrections Required\n  * VOID Sheet Process\n\n\n\n## **What's Next?**\n\nTo get a step-by-step guide on PLUS statuses and what they mean, see our What is My PLUS Status?

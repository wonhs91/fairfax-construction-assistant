The primary changes to the Zoning Ordinance include:\n\n  * Simple and clear parking-related processes and minimum parking rates\n  * Lower minimum requirements related to planned land density\n  * More parking adjustment (reduction) options\n  * New minimum bicycle parking requirements\n\n\n\n### Related Resources\n\nParking Reimagined Project FAQs\n\nCounty News Article on Parking Reimagined\n\n## Why the Change?\n\nVehicle parking drives many elements of land-use design and decision-making. It also consumes land area. The adopted changes to parking requirements have major land use benefits:\n\n  * Adjusting the amount of parking to avoid excessive and unused parking lots and garages.\n  * Right-sizing parking to increase efficient design, community benefit, and reduce the environmental impact.\n  * Creating parking tailored to community planning and transportation using a tiered framework.\n  * Allowing for more flexibility and predictability to parking decisions.\n\n\n\n## Determining Parking Supply\n\nNew tools are available to assist customers in determining their minimum parking need including a parking calculator (available soon). The calculator can be used to determine a minimum parking requirement for a site. The Parking Reimagined GIS map is useful to quickly determine what parking requirement tier is applicable to your site.\n\nZoning Ordinance Subsections 6100.1, 6100.4 and 6100.5 outline:\n\n  * When a parking tabulation is required.\n  * What the baseline minimum parking requirements are by use.\n  * How to use an applied tiered framework for minimum parking requirements.\n\n\n\nThe changes to the Zoning Ordinance are intended to limit the times when a parking tabulation is necessary.\n\nOther modifications in Subsection 6100.1 provide more flexibility for use changes within existing sites without the need for additional parking spaces.\n\n### Related Resources\n\nParking Tier Analysis Interactive Map\n\nParking Calculator\n\n## Modifications to Parking\n\nLand Development Services is involved in off-street parking management in three primary areas:\n\n## \n\n##  Parking Adjustments \n\nFormerly known as parking reductions, these are opportunities to lower the supplied parking below any minimum requirement. A formal justification by a professional engineer is required. Parking adjustment options and criteria are found in Subsection 6100.6.\n\n  * Background Information on Parking Adjustments\n  * Parking Adjustment Request Guidelines and Checklist Example\n  * Standard Parking Reduction Conditions\n\n\n\nBelow is an example table of a new standard shared parking calculation available in the Zoning Ordinance. This is provided for guidance on these types of submittals.\n\nUse | Variables | # of Spaces | Weekday Daytime | Weekday Evening | Weekend Daytime | Weekend Evening  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nMulti-Family | 1.3 x 300 units | 390 | 0.6 x 390 = 234 | 1.0 x 390 = 390 | 0.9 x 390 = 351 | 1.0 x 390 = 390  \nOffice | 2.0 x 125,000 GSF | 250 | 1.0 x 250 = 250 | 0.05 x 250 = 12 | 0.05 x 250 = 12 | 0.05 x 250 = 12  \nHotel | 1.0 x 150 rooms | 150 | 0.8 x 150 = 120 | 1.0 x 150 = 150 | 0.8 x 150 = 120 | 1.0 x 150 = 150  \nRestaurant | 8.0 x 6,500 GSF | 52 | 0.5 x 52 = 26 | 0.8 x 52 = 41 | 0.8 x 52 = 41 | 1.0 x 52 = 52  \nCommercial Uses | 4.0 x 50,000 GSF | 200 | 0.6 x 200 = 120 | 0.9 x 200 = 180 | 1.0 x 200 = 200 | 0.7 x 200 = 140  \nTotal Spaces |  | 1042 | 750 | 773 | 724 | 744  \n**Req'd Parking** |  |  |  | 773 |  |   \n  \n_Variables relate to the applicable rate in Section 6 of the Zoning Ordinance. For square footages, convert 1,000s to a decimal place. Example: 100,000 gross square feet = 100; 6,500 gross square feet = 6.5._\n\n##  Parking Redesignation Plan \n\nA parking redesignation plan shows a proposed re-striping of the layout of site parking spaces. Submission of this plan is required when parking spaces are redesignated (added, eliminated, re-arranged or reconfigured) at a site and no other changes require submission of a site plan or minor site plan. The redesignation plan cannot reduce the number of site spaces below the minimum requirement.\n\n##  Parking Tabulations \n\nThe current tabulation form is linked below. A formal submittal for staff review and approval is required under the defined criteria in the Ordinance. A new tabulation form that includes the changes to the parking requirements is under development and will be available soon.\n\n## Opt-in to Planned Tysons Corner (PTC) Rates\n\nFor existing sites in the Tysons Urban Core and Transit Oriented Development (TOD) districts, an option is available to assume the lower parking rates for these areas. Requests to reduce the number of parking spaces in these areas are submitted as Tysons Rate Redesignations (i.e., Tysons Opt-ins). The addition of an eligible use at the property will require approval from LDS when changes to the site require submission of a site plan, a minor site plan, a parking tabulation or a 2-step parking redesignation submission.\n\n  \n\n\n## Bicycle Parking\n\nNew minimum rates for bicycle parking and other design and location requirements were established in 2024 to ensure the placement of bicycle facilities. The requirements apply to all forms of development.\n\n  \n\n\n## Notification Tool for New Parking Adjustment Applications\n\nLDS offers a monthly notification service to receive monthly updates about new parking adjustment applications.\n\nSubscribe to Email Notifications\n\n##  PLUS Applications \n\n  * Log into PLUS \n  * LDS PLUS Support\n  * YouTube Help Videos\n\n\n\n## Related Resources\n\n  * Tutorial Video on New Parking Requirements\n  * Fees\n  * Permit Library\n  * Information about Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) permits, including the design expectations available in the EVC memorandum and checklist.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nNeed Help? Call **703-222-0801** , **TTY 711**.\n\nMonday through Thursday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Friday from 9:15 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n  * LDS Permit Library: Access guides to navigate every record type in PLUS.\n  * Letters to Industry: Subscribe for LDS announcements, notices, and tech bulletins.\n  * Meet With Staff: Find a staff member to help you with the permit process.\n\n\n",

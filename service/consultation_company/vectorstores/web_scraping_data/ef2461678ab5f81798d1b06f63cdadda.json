Addresses cannot be added to the Master Address Repository (MAR) by GIS until a PLUS application is submitted. \n\nPlease note, if you currently have a submitted plan in review with the county, the approved address for the plan will be added to MAR once the plan has been approved by the Site Development and Inspections Division (SDID). If a parcel is currently under bond, then an address change must be submitted via a revision to the originally approved site plan. If the address request is the only proposed change, then the submission qualifies as a minor revision that can be reviewed, approved, and issued by FAC staff.\n\nFor additional details, including FAQs, see Addressing and Street Names.  \n\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## **WHO SHOULD APPLY?**\n\nProperty owners or their duly authorized agents, Board of Supervisors, the Department of Public Safety, and other jurisdictions such as Town of Herndon and Town of Vienna may submit address change requests.

You will see your new address in MAR and PLUS the following business day, however, other county systems could take up to a week to fully update.\n\nEvery week, FAC staff issues a report of all new and expired addresses. This report is sent to all county agencies, including Public Safety (or 911), and the U.S. Postal Service. Your approval letter may be used immediately to update personal correspondents, which may include utility companies, telephone companies, banks, and other personal accounts.\n\nHelpful Video:\n\n**Access Approved Plans in PLUS - YouTube Video**\n\n## **Additional Resources**\n\n  * Real Estate Assessment\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n### **Need More Assistance?**\n\nFor questions or additional information, please visit the Facilitation and Addressing Center website or via telephone at 703-222-0801, TTY 711.\n\n  \n\n\nBack to Top\n\n### Was this guide helpful?

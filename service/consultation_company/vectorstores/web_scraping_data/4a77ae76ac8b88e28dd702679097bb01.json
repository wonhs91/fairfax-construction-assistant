These letters are often requested by a seller, contract purchaser, lender, Department of Motor Vehicles, or Virginia Department of Housing to obtain written verification that the property complies with zoning regulations prior to its transfer or issuance of licenses.\n\n## HOW TO SUBMIT A REQUEST\n\nAll zoning compliance letter requests must be submitted electronically through the PLUS application portal.\n\nFor additional information on how to use the PLUS application portal, please visit the DPD PLUS Information & Support page. Instructional videos are available on the Fairfax County PLUS - YouTube channel.\n\nIf you have technical questions (e.g. account setup, password issues) regarding the PLUS system, please contact the Help Desk:\n\n  * Hours of Operation: Mon. - Fri., 8 a.m. - 4 p.m.\n  * PLUSSupport@FairfaxCounty.gov | 703-324-2222, TTY 711\n\n\n\nLaunch PLUS\n\n## Additional Information\n\n  * A request for a Zoning Compliance Letter may take up to 30 calendar days to process.\n  * The application fee is $135 for each single-family lot requested and $375 for each lot requested for all other uses.

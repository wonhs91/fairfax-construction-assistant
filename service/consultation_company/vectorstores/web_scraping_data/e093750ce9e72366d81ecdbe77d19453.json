Through PLUS, customers can conduct online transactions under the Departments of Health, Land Development Services, Fire and Rescue, Code Compliance and Planning and Development. Customers can create and submit applications online (such as building permits), pay fees, track application status, receive electronic notifications and conduct searches. PLUS replaced all legacy systems (FIDO, PAWS and ProjectDox) beginning October 31, 2022.\n\nTo use the new services on the PLUS platform, applicants must first register for a free account at PLUS Application Portal. Others can browse and search the site without logging in. \n\n## PLUS Application Portal\n\nPLUS can be used to track current applications, make changes to these applications or to start a new application.\n\nPlease Note: Microsoft Edge is the preferred browser for PLUS.\n\nLaunch PLUS\n\n  \n\n\nDPD specific applications or processes that have moved to PLUS and are now accepted digitally are listed in the sections below by release (click to expand).

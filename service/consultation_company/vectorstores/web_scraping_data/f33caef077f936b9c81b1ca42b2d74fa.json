These changes are necessary to incorporate revisions to the state Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Designation and Management Regulations adopted by the State Water Control Board.\n\n**Effective Date:**\n\nOctober 9, 2024, at 12:01 a.m., and the requirements be applicable to any new plans and applications submitted on or after this date, except that all previously approved Water Quality Impact Assessments and RPA exception and exemption requests remain valid for the period indicated in the approval. \n\nApplicants who submit a plan or application before the effective date that is then accepted for review without further modification may continue to use the criteria in effect at the time of the submission only if the plan or application is approved within six months of the effective date and any previously approved Water Quality Impact Assessments and RPA exception and exemption approvals remain valid for the time period granted in the approval.\n\n**Documents:**\n\n  * Adopted Amendment\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n**Amendment to the Code of the County of Fairfax, Virginia (County Code) to adopt new Chapter 124.1 (Erosion and Stormwater Management Ordinance) and repeal Chapter 104 (Erosion and Sedimentation Control) and Chapter 124 (Stormwater Management Ordinance) in their entirety.**\n\nThe amendment consolidates the existing erosion and sediment control requirements, stormwater management requirements, and provisions to satisfy the County\u2019s state-issued municipal separate storm sewer permit into a single ordinance. The ordinance clarifies program requirements, eliminates redundancies, and corrects inconsistencies between the existing ordinances. There are no substantive changes to existing erosion and sediment control minimum standards or to the post-construction stormwater management technical criteria. The ordinance requires all land-disturbing activities equal to or greater than 2,500 square feet to provide erosion and sediment control, water quantity control, and water quality control. The Board did not adopt the optional provision that would have exempted land-disturbing activity equal to or greater than 2,500 square feet and less than one acre for construction of single-family detached residential structures not part of a common plan of development or sale meeting certain criteria from providing water quality control.\n\n**Effective Date:**\n\n  * July 1, 2024, at 12:01 a.m. except that for land-disturbing activity that would have been eligible for the exemption under Section 124-1-7(3) of the Stormwater Management Ordinance and for which lot grading plans were accepted for review prior to July 1, 2024, the effective date of the water quality technical criteria set forth in the Erosion and Stormwater Management Ordinance is January 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n**Documents:**\n\n  * Adopted Amendment\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n**Amendments to Appendix Q (Land Development Services Fee Schedule) of the Code of the County of Fairfax, Virginia Regarding Adjustment of the Fees Charged by Land Development Services for Plan Review, Permits and Inspection Services.**\n\nThe amendment adjusts fees charged for plan review, permits, and inspection services to meet the Board\u2019s direction for approximately 100% cost recovery and to support Land Development Services\u2019 efforts to enhance customer service during the land development review process. \n\n**Effective Date:**\n\n  * July 1, 2024, the proposed amendments to the Appendix Q, Land Development Services Fee Schedule, of the Fairfax County Vode, with fees as set forth in Attachment One, to the memorandum dated April 15, 2024.\n  * July 1, 2025, the proposed amendments to Appendix Q, Land Development Services Fee Schedule, of the Fairfax County Code, with the Full amount of fees set forth in the Staff Report dated March 5, 2024.

It amends the sewer availability provisions of Section 65-6-6 of the County Code by adding a reference to the Board-adopted Sewer Policy to clarify that availability of the public sewer service under Section 65-6-6 of the County Code is subject to the Sewer Policy.  \n  \n**Effective Date:**\n\n  * Sept. 27, 2023, at 12:01 a.m.\n\n\n\n**Documents:**\n\n  * Board Package\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n**Proposed Amendment to Chapter 122 (Tree Conservation Ordinance)** of The Code of the County of Fairfax, Virginia (County Code) Re: Tree Commission Charter\n\nThe Tree Commission was created by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors (Board) to advise the Board on matters related to the preservation and planting of trees.

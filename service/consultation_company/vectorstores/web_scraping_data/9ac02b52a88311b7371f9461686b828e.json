This page provides information about the review process.\n\n## \n\nLDS Review Programs\n\n##  Adaptive Reuse Program \n\nAdaptive reuse is the process of changing the use of an existing building for any purpose other than it was originally designed for. The Adaptive Reuse Program seeks to promote the reuse of existing buildings by providing incentives, guidance, and reduced review timeframe.\n\n##  Expedited Building Plan Review \n\nThis program offers a method to obtain a building permit in at least half the usual time. The program enables the use of county-certified, private-sector, registered design professionals to \u201cpeer review\u201d construction documents for code compliance prior to submission to the county.\n\n##  Fast Track Program \n\nThe Fast Track Program provides priority plan review for non-complex commercial and residential projects on a first-come, first-serve basis. Qualifying commercial projects such as sales offices, awnings and tenant fit-outs up to 10,000 square feet. Residential projects such as decks, finished basements and small additions up to 500 square feet. Learn more about the Fast Track Program.\n\n##  Green Building Priority Plan Review \n\nTo promote green building practices, qualifying residential and commercial projects are eligible for benefits during the building plan review process. More on the Green Building Priority Plan Review process.\n\n##  Modified Processing \n\nThe modified processing procedures allow for issuance of Rough Grading Permits, partial (footing and foundation) permits and extensions of partial permits on projects with $50 million worth of improvements or more, prior to full approval of site and building plans.\n\n##  Revitalization Districts \n\nRevitalization Districts provide guidelines for building owners, designers and developers on the resources available when altering or rehabilitating buildings in revitalization districts.\n\n##  Residential Electrical Service Review \n\nThe Residential Electrical Service Review form allows you to submit your 600 amp or 800 amp residential service plan and obtain a review with county staff within 48 hours of submission.\n\n__\n\n## County Details\n\nTypical county details are documents that serve as pre-approved architectural plans and can be used in lieu of an architectural plan submission during the permit application process.

Consider applying for a code modification if:\n\n  * Your project's design or construction does not meet the letter of the building code, but you feel it complies with its intent.\n  * A code provision from an edition of the code that Virginia has yet to adopt better addresses your design or construction.\n  * You have an alternate design, unknown method or new material that is not addressed in the code.\n\n\n\nEach modification is unique to a specific project and cannot be construed as a countywide or statewide code interpretation. A code modification is not a variance or a relaxation of a requirement; the Building Official does not have the authority to waive provisions of the code.  \n\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Can Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## WHO CAN APPLY?\n\nThe administrative provisions of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code permit the owner of the property or the owner\u2019s agent to apply for a code modification. The owner\u2019s agent may include an architect, an engineer, a general contractor, or somebody else whom the owner may designate.\n\n## PLAN AHEAD\n\nBefore submitting, ensure you are aware of all applicable regulations and conditions that could affect your project to avoid surprises during the review process. Some of those factors include:\n\n  * Design Codes and Standards\n  * Manufacturers Installation Instructions\n  * Product Evaluation Reports\n\n\n\n## HOW DO I SUBMIT MY RECORD?\n\n### **PLUS Application**\n\nApply for your **code modification** online in PLUS under the **Building****** tab.

Building Plans Infographic.\n\n### Review Process\n\nThe Building Official and the Code Modification Review Committee will evaluate the technical merits of the proposed code modification.

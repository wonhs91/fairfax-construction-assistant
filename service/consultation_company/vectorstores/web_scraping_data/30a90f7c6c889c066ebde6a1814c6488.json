The assessment gathers historical and other readily available information on site conditions and surroundings to evaluate whether the site poses a potential threat to human health and the environment and whether further investigation is needed. An environmental site assessment is usually associated with entitlement applications that have been approved by the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors (e.g., rezonings and special exceptions) and include proffers or development conditions requiring the submission of an ESA.  \n\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## **WHO SHOULD APPLY?**\n\nProperty owners or their duly authorized agents may submit environmental site assessments, however, the assessment must be prepared and certified by an environmental professional licensed by the Commonwealth of Virginia and meeting the respective code requirements.\n\n  * Verify License on DPOR Website\n  * Hiring a Contractor\n\n\n\n## **PLAN AHEAD**\n\nBefore submitting, ensure you are aware of all applicable regulations and conditions that could affect your project to avoid surprises during the review process.

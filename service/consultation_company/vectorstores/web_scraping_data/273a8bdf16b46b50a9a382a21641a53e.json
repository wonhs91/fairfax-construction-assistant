The ARB was established in subsection 8103.4 of the Fairfax County Zoning Ordinance.\n\n  \n\n\nThe purpose of the ARB is to administer the regulations of Historic Overlay Districts under Section 3101 of the Zoning Ordinance and to advise and assist the Board of Supervisors in its efforts to preserve and protect historic, architectural, and archaeological resources in the County.\n\nStaff of the County\u2019s Department of Planning and Development (DPD) administer the work of the Architectural Review Board and can answer any general or procedural questions about Historic Overlay Districts and the ARB review process. Proposals may be brought before the ARB by any landowner or their representative, or a contract purchaser.\n\n## ARB Meeting Information\n\nThe ARB meets at 6:30 p.m. on the second Thursday of each month at the Fairfax County Government Center. Applicants should contact the DPD staff administrator at 703-324-1380, TTY 711 for information on ARB procedures and to be placed on the agenda for a regularly scheduled ARB meeting.\n\n### Related Resources\n\nView Architectural Review Board Meeting Schedule & Agendas\n\nArchitectural Review Board Approved Meeting Minutes\n\n## Application Process & Submission Schedule\n\nThe ARB conducts two types of review: informal or \u201cworkshop\u201d review, and formal review for approval or recommendation.

Since then, the Board of Supervisors has created two additional Historic Overlay Districts, bringing the current total to fifteen.\n\n### Related Resources\n\nHistoric Overlay Districts\n\nHistoric Overlay District Design Guidelines\n\n## ARB Bylaws\n\nThe Fairfax County Architectural Review Board adopts Bylaws for its rules and procedures for the transaction of its business for the benefit and convenience of the citizens of Fairfax County.\n\n  * View Bylaws\n\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nFrequently asked questions regarding Historic Overlay Districts and Architectural Review Board (ARB).\n\n  * View FAQs\n\n\n\n## Subscribe for Updates\n\nTo receive periodic email updates about the Architectural Review Board (ARB), including meeting announcements and agendas, subscribe to the ARB email list.  \n\n\nSubscribe\n\n  \n\n",

The purpose of the WQIA is to ensure protection of RPAs consistent with the goals, objectives and requirements of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Ordinance of Fairfax County. Generally, WQIAs are required for any land disturbance, development or redevelopment within an RPA unless exempt under Article 5 . WQIAs may also be required for development or redevelopment immediately adjacent to the RPA, if the director determines that such an assessment is necessary because of the unique characteristics of the site or because the intensity of the proposed development may cause significant impacts to the RPA. The code required WQIA components are listed in \u00a7 118-4-3. WQIAs are divided into \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cmajor\u201d categories. See Technical Bulletin 20-02: New Application and Submittal Requirements for details.\n\n  \nDepending on the scope of your project, you may need to apply for a separate building permit record in PLUS.

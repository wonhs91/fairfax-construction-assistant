Accessible parking is required with any construction of parking for a land use. To ensure that the accessible parking supply is maintained at pre-2024 levels, staff evaluated and is considering modified requirements for accessible parking. On July 23, 2024, staff presented an update of this project to the Board of Supervisor\u2019s Land Use Policy Committee. In response to this presentation the Board directed staff to draft a Zoning Ordinance Amendment, that ensures stability in the supply of accessible parking. \n\n## Staff Report\n\nThe staff report for the Review of Modified Accessible Parking Requirements proposed Zoning Ordinance amendment is available for review ahead of the public hearings before the Planning Commission on 10/30 and Board of Supervisors on 12/3.\n\nView Staff Report\n\n### Related Resources\n\nBoard Matter & Resolution (9/24/2024)\n\nAccessible Parking Memorandum to the Board (6/25/2024)\n\n## \n\nCommunity Engagement\n\n##  Public Hearings \n\n**Planning Commission:** Wednesday**,** October 30, 2024 at 7:30 p.m. \n\n**Board of Supervisors:** Tuesday, December 3, 2024 at 4:30 p.m.\n\n##  Past Meetings & Materials \n\n**Disability Services Board Meeting**   \nNovember 13, 2023\n\n* * *\n\n**Disability Services Board Meeting**  \nMay 13, 2024\n\n* * *\n\n**NVBIA/NAIOP Meeting**   \nMay 16, 2024\n\n* * *\n\n**Board of Supervisors\u2019 Land Use Policy Committee**  \nTuesday, July 23, 2024\n\nMeeting Video | Meeting Presentation\n\n* * *\n\n**Lunch & Learn**  \nWednesday, September 4, 2024 \n\nMeeting Video\n\n* * *\n\n**Planning Commission Land Use Process Review Committee**  \nThursday, September 12, 2024\n\n* * *\n\n**Community Meeting**  \nWednesday, September 18, 2024\n\n## Contact Us\n\nFor questions or comments about the proposed amendment, please contact Mike Davis, Land Development Services, by email or at 703-222-0801.\n",

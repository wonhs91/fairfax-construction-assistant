These uses, described as special exception uses, may be allowed to locate within designated zoning districts under the controls, limitations, and regulations of a special exception approved by the Board of Supervisors.\n\nThe Board may approve a special exception that complies with all applicable standards, that will be compatible with existing and planned development in the general area, and that, as conditioned, will be compatible with the neighborhood where it is proposed to be located. If it determines that the use is not in accordance with all applicable standards of this Ordinance, the Board must deny the special exception. \n\nIn order to request consideration of a special exception, an application must be filed with the County. A special exception must meet specific submission requirements, including the provision of a fee and an affidavit, as set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.\n\n## Process Overview\n\n  1. Application is filed electronically through the PLUS application portal by the applicant.\n  2. Application submissions are reviewed.

Click to Enlarge.**_\n\nThe Expedited Building Plan Review Program (EBPR) offers building permit applicants an opportunity for their plan review times to be cut in half while ensuring their plans are code compliant. EBPR program is available for all project types and is most effective for commercial tenant fit outs.\n\nKeys to program success are the carefully vetted, Fairfax County certified \u201cPeer Reviewers\u201d. These are registered architects and professional engineers who are highly qualified through years of design and review experience, certification by the International Code Council and a record of success with the county building plans review process. Peer reviewer performance is monitored, and under-performers are invited to exit the program.\n\nOwners and developers, especially those unfamiliar with the Fairfax County building permit process, are encouraged to employ peer reviewers during the initial design phase to help streamline the design/development process.\n\nPeer reviewers are hired by the owner / developer to accommodate the design schedule and to enforce the Virginia Construction Code and Fairfax County requirements in the building official\u2019s stead.\n\nAll are cautioned to remember that peer reviewers are not a part of the design team. Rather, they are a knowledgeable resource with code enforcement responsibilities like those of county staff. Read about peer reviewer conflict of interest below.\n\nThe process begins with the owner/developer decision to opt into the program. The Fairfax County building official allows all qualified projects admission to the program. Pre-approval is vested in the list of **certified peer reviewers**.\n\nOnce submitted, permit issuance is expedited as the peer reviewed plans are given priority status. Highly complex plans may not see time savings on the first county review; however, the number of reviews is expected to be fewer, yielding a lower overall time to permit.\n\nIf you have additional questions, please contact Building Plan Review at **703-222-0801** , Option 2, Option 3.\n\n## How the Program Works\n\n  * **Step 1:** A building owner or developer contracts directly for peer reviewers\u2019 services and hires certified Peer Reviewers for their project from the **Certified Peer Reviewer List**.  \n\n  * **Step 2:** The construction documents are submitted to the Peer Reviewers for review.  \n\n  * **Step 3:** The construction documents are thoroughly reviewed by the Peer Reviewers. Once the drawings meet the code requirements, the Peer Reviewers certify the drawings and recommend them for submission to the county.  \n\n  * **Step 4:** The construction documents are submitted to the county for review. Drawings submitted under this program are given the highest priority by county reviewers. Please note, in many cases, county reviewers may find additional code deficiencies or missing documentation. Corrections submitted to address county review comments are not required to be peer reviewed\n\n\n\n## Corrections\n\nSimple corrections submitted to address county review comments are not required to be peer reviewed. However, complex changes without peer review may be grounds for removal from the program.\n\n## Revisions after permit issuance\n\nAlterations after the permit has been issued are revisions. Revisions shall be peer reviewed prior to submission to the county or shall be removed from the program. Removal from the program may be more problematic for plans that were administratively reviewed. In many cases, county reviewers may find additional code deficiencies. \n\n## How to Become a Peer Reviewer\n\nIf you are an architect or professional engineer and you wish to obtain certification as a Peer Reviewer, you must meet the minimum qualifications and program requirements listed below.\n\n### Licensed Professional\n\nTo be a certified Peer Reviewer you must hold a valid and current license in the commonwealth of Virginia as a professional engineer or architect.\n\n### ICC Certifications and Examinations\n\nEach Peer Reviewer must hold certifications from the International Code Council as shown in the table below in order to be certified as a Peer Reviewer for the specific component.

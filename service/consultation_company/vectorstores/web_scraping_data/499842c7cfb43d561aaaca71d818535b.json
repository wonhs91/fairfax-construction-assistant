If a food truck operates on more than one site, only one food truck operation application is required to be obtained from the Zoning Administrator for such food truck, provided that the property owner on any additional sites has obtained a food truck location permit for that site, the food truck operator has written consent from the property owner or authorized agent to operate on that site, and the food truck is operating in conformance with that approval. The operation of any food truck is subject to all Health Department and Department of Cable and Consumer Services permits/licenses. \n\n(c) Upon the finding that the application complies with the standards set forth in subsection (5) below, the Zoning Administrator will approve the permit application, setting forth conditions that protect the public health, safety and welfare and adequately protect adjoining properties from any adverse impacts of the food truck, which may include, but are not limited to, hours of operation, location, parking, vehicular access, and safety requirements. \n\n(5) All food trucks must be located and operated in compliance with the following standards: \n\n(a) Food trucks must be located on private property with the written consent of the property owner or authorized agent holding an approved food truck location permit. \n\n(b) Food trucks may only be permitted in conjunction with a principal use consisting of a minimum of 25,000 square feet of gross floor area or on a construction site with an active building permit and on-going construction activity.

Unless otherwise specified in any zoning approval, all provisions of this Section 4102.8.E apply. \n\n**Standards when permitted by special exception or special permit:**\n\n(9) The Board or BZA, as applicable, in conjunction with the approval for a nonresidential use in a residential district or a residential area of a planned district, may allow food trucks in excess of twelve times per calendar year.\n\n## Contact Information\n\n  * Department of Cable and Consumer Services, 703-324-5966\n  * Fairfax County Park Authority, 703-324-8700\n  * Health Department, 703-246-2444\n  * Department of Planning and Development, Zoning Administration Division, 703-324-1314\n\n\n",

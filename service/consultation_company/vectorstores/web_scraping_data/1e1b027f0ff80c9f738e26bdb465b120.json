The Building Division project management team is designed to guide a project by identifying and filling in gaps during the process. For a complex project, the Building Division project manager will proactively communicate with project stakeholders, develop a project plan, identify tasks and deliverables, create a preliminary schedule, and determine the critical path through the plan review process. Once a project is in the system, the project manager will monitor, control and adjust as necessary to leverage efficiencies. These project managers are technically savvy and customer-service oriented with quality experience and knowledge of the land development process in Fairfax County. **To reach one of our Building Division Project Managers, call 703-324-7554, TTY 711.**\n\n## BUILDING DIVISION PROJECT MANAGERS\n\n#### Behrouz Hasheminejad, P.E.\n\nBehrouz has a B.S. in mechanical engineering and has worked as a mechanical and plumbing design engineer for nine years prior to joining the county in 2013.

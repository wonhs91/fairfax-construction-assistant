The Fairfax County Comprehensive Plan is evaluated more frequently to manage the dynamic changes in the County and to conduct Plan maintenance. Plan amendments are initiated by a motion by the Board of Supervisors. In order for an amendment to be adopted, it must be the subject of a public hearing before the Planning Commission (PC) and the Board of Supervisors (BOS). See the Planning Commission's Meeting Calendar for information about currently scheduled Planning Commission public hearings. The Board of Supervisors must vote to adopt the amendment in order to change the Plan. \n\nStaff reports for the proposed amendments scheduled for public hearing are listed below.

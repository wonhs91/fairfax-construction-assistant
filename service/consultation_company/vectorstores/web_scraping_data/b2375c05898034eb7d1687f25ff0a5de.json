If the legality of a lot is unclear, a lot validation can determine whether the lot meets certain requirements and can be validated so that a building permit may potentially be issued for the development of that lot. County Code Sections 101-1-12, 101-1-13, and 101-1-14 describe the process for validating a lot. Once the review is complete, the county will issue a written determination as to whether a land parcel is a valid lot or unbuildable outlot.\n\nA \u201cvalid\u201d lot may not be a \u201cbuildable\u201d lot. For a lot to be \u201cbuildable\u201d, it must meet the minimum yard and floodplain requirements of the Fairfax County Zoning Ordinance, the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Ordinance, and the appropriate erosion and sedimentation and stormwater measures. In addition, the lot must have legal access from a public road and all necessary well and septic permits must be obtained.\n\nBefore proceeding with a Lot Validation request, please consider the following:\n\n  * Per Zoning Ordinance 112.1.5100.2J, any lot recorded before March 1, 1941 is a valid lot and does **not** require a formal Lot Validation submission.\n  * If your lot was created between March 1, 1941 and March 25, 2003, it is a valid lot if it is identified as a separate lot on the Fairfax County Real Property Identification Map and contained a principal structure on March 9, 2004 and therefore does **not** require a formal Lot Validation submission.\n  * If your lot has red property boundary lines as shown on the Digital Map Viewer, this is an indication that the property was split but did not go through the subdivision control process. Verification of property lines may be accomplished by a licensed land surveyor or by submitting a Lot Validation request to the county. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, as of 2018, the Department of Tax Administration (DTA) no longer considers **lot consolidations** for administrative tax purposes. All previously consolidated tax map numbers created to receive one tax bill have been grandfathered. Property owners wishing to consolidate multiple parcels must record a deed of consolidation with Fairfax County Land Records. For more information, please contact @DTA RED or visit DTA\u2019s website.\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## **WHO SHOULD APPLY?**\n\nProperty owners or their duly authorized agents may submit lot validation applications.\n\n  * Verify License on DPOR Website\n  * Hiring a Contractor\n\n\n\n## **PLAN AHEAD**\n\nBefore submitting, ensure you are aware of all applicable regulations and conditions that could affect your project to avoid surprises during the review process.

Such facilities are essential to support the community and its development and to enhance the overall quality of life.\n\nPublic facilities include (but are not limited to) the following elements:\n\n  * Education - public schools and higher education\n  * Libraries\n  * Public Safety Services - police, fire and rescue, sheriff, courts, animal control\n  * Health & Human Services\n  * Parks & Recreation\n  * Utilities and Services - water supply, sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage systems and stormwater management, vehicle maintenance facilities, gas, electric, telephone, and communications\n\n\n\nSome facilities are generally not reviewed under the 2232 process. (See the list of exempt facilities).\n\n## 2232 Review\n\nThe term 2232 Review derives from the Code of Virginia Section 15.2-2232. Fairfax County's 2232 review process determines the compatibility of proposed public facilities with the locational guidelines established in the Comprehensive Plan. Specifically, this process determines if the general or approximate location, character, and extent are in substantial accord with the Fairfax County Comprehensive Plan. Enlargements, changes of use, and other changes to public areas may also be subject to 2232 review process.\n\n## HOW TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION\n\nAll non-telecommunication Public Facility (2232 review) applications must be submitted electronically through the PLUS application portal.

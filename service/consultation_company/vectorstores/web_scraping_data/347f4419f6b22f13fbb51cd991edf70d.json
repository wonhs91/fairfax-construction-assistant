This construction type history chart shows the progression of how buildings were classified throughout the evolution of the building codes. The chart helps to correlate those old construction type classification references to those used currently in our newly adopted building codes.\n\n## Evolution of Construction Types\n\nCode Name | Editions | NC*  \nProtected | NC*  \nProtected | NC*  \nProtected | NC*  \nProtected | NC*  \nUnprotected | NC/C*  \nProtected | NC/C*  \nUnprotected | NC/C*  \nHeavy Timber | Combustible  \nProtected | Combustible  \nUnprotected  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nICC International Building Code | 2000 - Present | IA | IA | IB | IIA | IIB | IIIA | IIIB | IV | VA | VB  \nBOCA National Building Code | 1984 - 1996 | 1A | 1B | 2A | 2B | 2C | 3A | 3B | 4 | 5A | 5B  \nBOCA Basic Building Code | 1960 - 1981 | 1A | 1B | 2A | 2B | 2C | 3B | 3C | 3A | 4A | 5B  \n  \n* NC = Noncombustible  \n** C = Combustible\n\n## USBC Adoption and Referenced Codes\n\nEdition | Effective  \nDate | BOCA  \nBuilding  \nCode | BOCA  \nMechanical  \nCode | BOCA  \nPlumbing  \nCode | National  \nElectrical  \nCode | CABO  \nModel  \nEnergy  \nCode | CABO  \nOne- and Two- Family  \nDwelling Code | International  \nBuilding  \nCode | International  \nMechanical  \nCode | International  \nPlumbing  \nCode | International  \nFuel-Gas  \nCode | International  \nResidential  \nCode | International  \nEnergy  \nConservation  \nCode | International  \nSwimming  \nPool and Spa  \nCode  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1973 | 4/1/1973 | 1970* | 1970 | 1970* | 1971 |  | 1971 |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n1975** | 2/7/1976 | 1975 | 1975 | 1975 | 1975 |  | 1975 |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n1978** | 8/1/1978 | 1978 | 1978 | 1978 | 1978 |  | 1975 |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n1981 | 7/16/1982 | 1981 | 1981 | 1981 | 1981 | 1977 | 1979* |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n1984 | 4/1/1986 | 1984 | 1984 | 1984 | 1984 | 1983 | 1983* |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n1987 | 3/1/1988 | 1987 | 1987 | 1987 | 1987 | 1986 | 1986* |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n1990 | 3/1/1991 | 1990 | 1990 | 1990 | 1990 | 1989 | 1989* |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n1993 | 4/1/1994 | 1993 | 1993 | 1993 | 1993 | 1993 | 1992* |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n1996 | 4/15/1997 | 1996 |  |  | 1996 | 1995 | 1995 |  | 1996 | 1995* |  |  |  |   \n2000 | 10/1/2003 |  |  |  | 1999 |  |  | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 |   \n2003 | 11/16/2005 |  |  |  | 2002 |  |  | 2003 | 2003 | 2003 | 2003 | 2003 | 2003 |   \n2006 | 5/1/2008 |  |  |  | 2005 |  |  | 2006 | 2006 | 2006 | 2006 | 2006 | 2006 |   \n2009 | 3/1/2011 |  |  |  | 2008 |  |  | 2009 | 2009 | 2009 | 2009 | 2009 | 2009 |   \n2012 | 7/14/2014 |  |  |  | 2011 |  |  | 2012 | 2012 | 2012 | 2012 | 2012 | 2012 | 2012  \n2015 | 9/4/2018 |  |  |  | 2014 |  |  | 2015 | 2015 | 2015 | 2015 | 2015 | 2015 | 2015  \n2018 | 7/21/2021 |  |  |  | 2017 |  |  | 2018 | 2018 | 2018 | 2018 | 2018 | 2018 | 2018  \n  \n* with following year(s) amendments  \n** supplement to the 1973 USBC  \n\n\n  \nNeed Help?

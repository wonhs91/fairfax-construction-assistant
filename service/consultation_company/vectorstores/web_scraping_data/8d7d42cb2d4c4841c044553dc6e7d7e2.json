Per Section 108.1-6-1 \u2013 Waivers, any person responsible for any noise source may apply to the Zoning Administrator for a waiver or partial waiver from these provisions. Examples of activities that typically request noise waivers include construction projects at school sites, roadwork, and other similar activities.\n\nHowever, the Zoning Administrator may only grant a waiver or partial waiver upon a finding that: \n\n  * The noise does not endanger the public health, safety, or welfare; or \n  * Compliance would produce serious hardship without producing equal or greater benefit to the public; and \n  * Reasonable efforts are made to minimize the adverse impacts of the noise on adjacent properties.\n\n\n\nAdditional information about the Noise Ordinance is available on the Noise Ordinance webpage.\n\n## HOW TO SUBMIT A REQUEST\n\nAll noise waiver requests must be submitted electronically through the PLUS application portal.\n\nFor additional information on how to use the PLUS application portal, please visit the DPD PLUS Information & Support page. Instructional videos are available on the Fairfax County PLUS - YouTube channel.\n\nIf you have technical questions (e.g. account setup, password issues) regarding the PLUS system, please contact the Help Desk:\n\n  * Hours of Operation: Mon. - Fri., 8 a.m. - 4 p.m.\n  * PLUSSupport@FairfaxCounty.gov | 703-324-2222, TTY 711\n\n\n\nLaunch PLUS\n\n## Additional Information\n\n  * All noise waiver requests must be submitted a minimum of 14 calendar days prior to the activity start date; however, earlier submission is encouraged, as it may take up to 14 calendar days to process a noise waiver request.\n  * There is no fee for a noise waiver request.\n  * If an activity will take place on multiple unconnected parcels, a separate noise waiver request will be required for each site.\n\n\n\n## Required Documents\n\n**Location map:** Using an aerial photograph or map, outline the location of the event or construction requiring the noise waiver. If construction involves milling or resurfacing of the roadway, highlight the relevant roadway, or portion of the roadway and identify the lane direction.\n\n**VDOT approval:** If construction is in the right of way, VDOT approval is required. Acceptable VDOT approval documents are either a VDOT permit or an email/letter from VDOT confirming the scope of work, location, and dates of construction. \n\n**Letter of permission:** If construction will be located on County or Fairfax County Public School owned property, a letter of permission from the associated County or School agency managing the project is required. This letter must be signed by the County or School project manager and include their contact information.\n\n## Contact Us\n\nFor additional assistance, please contact the Zoning Permits Section by phone at 703-222-1082 or by email.\n",

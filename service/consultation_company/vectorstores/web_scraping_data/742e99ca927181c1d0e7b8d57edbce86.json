Elevator inspections are documented by an inspection report which **fulfills the requirement of the Virginia Maintenance Code**. Fairfax County has the authority to issue a Notice of Violation and remove the equipment from service for the safety of Fairfax County residents and visitors.\n\n__\n\n## Violations\n\nAny violations noted in your periodic (six month) inspection will show in your annual inspection. If the items are still unaddressed at that time, your equipment will not pass its annual inspection and will require a re-inspection with associated fees.\n\nAny violations noted in your annual inspection shall require a re-inspection within forty days as noted on the inspection report. Associated re-inspection fees shall be assessed for a failed result. Should a reinspection not be scheduled and completed by the time your periodic (six month) inspection occurs, your equipment will fail its periodic inspection with associated fees assessed.\n\n## CHANGE OF CONTACT INFORMATION\n\nComplete this form to change contact information for:\n\n  * Owner Agent\n  * Onsite Contact\n  * Maintenance Company\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the building owner, or designated responsible party, to update this information.

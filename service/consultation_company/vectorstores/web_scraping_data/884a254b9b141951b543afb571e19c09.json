A rezoning is typically a change in the zoning classification of a property from an existing district to a different district, such as from R-1 (Residential District, One Dwelling Unit/Acre) to R-2 (Residential District, Two Dwelling Units/Acre).\n\nThe rezoning process consists of a number of steps as outlined below. Any rezoning proposal is subject to a detailed review and analysis by staff and public hearings before the Fairfax County Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors. The rezoning of land can only be approved by the Board of Supervisors.\n\nIn order to request consideration of a rezoning, an application must be filed with the County by the owners or their designated agent or contract purchasers of the land, and must meet specific submission requirements as laid out in section 8101 of the Zoning Ordinance. Review the Conventional Application Package for guidance related to proposals involving conventional districts (R-1, R-5, C-2, C-8, I-5, etc). Use the \u201cP\u201d District Application Package if the development proposal involves land to be located within one of the \u201cP\u201d Districts; Planned Development Housing (PDH), Planned Development Commercial (PDC), Planned Residential Community (PRC), Planned Tysons Corner (PTC), or Planned Continuing Care Facility (PCC). \u201cP\u201d districts are intended to encourage innovative and creative site design; to provide ample and efficient use of open space; to promote a mix of land uses and housing types and to allow flexibility to achieve excellence in all aspects site development.\n\n### Process Overview\n\n  1.

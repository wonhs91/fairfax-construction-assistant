The related property is being constructed under a bonded plan, so the associated utility installation falls under Fairfax County control, further regulated by Chapter 2: Property Under County Control, of The Code of The County of Fairfax. Utility permits are also required for property that is under Fairfax County control through ownership or easement agreements, including Chapter 2 Roads (unimproved non-county-maintained rights-of-way that have not been accepted into the VDOT secondary system and are named after the county code chapter describing procedures for managing county-owned property).  \n\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## **WHO SHOULD APPLY?**\n\nDevelopers, landowners, utility companies or their duly authorized agents may submit utility permit applications on their own, however, the plan itself must be certified by a professional engineer, land surveyor, architect or landscape architect licensed by the Commonwealth of Virginia and meeting the respective code requirements.\n\n  * Verify License on DPOR Website\n\n\n\n## **PLAN AHEAD**\n\nBefore submitting, ensure you are aware of all applicable regulations and conditions that could affect your project to avoid surprises during the review process.

The county can approve a waiver or variation where strict application of the standard cannot be met for a particular site or where new or creative designs are proposed. The proposed waiver or variation must meet the intent of the code provisions and a statement of justification for requesting the waiver or modification, including supporting data and information, must accompany the submission. Request for approval of a waiver, modification, and exception are all submitted as PLUS record type \u201cWaivers.\u201d A modification request requires county approval to modify a particular specification or requirement. An exception is a request for relief from the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the Stormwater Management Ordinance, or pursuant to the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Ordinance for work in the Resource Protection Area (RPA).\n\n  \nDepending on the scope of your project, you may need to apply for a separate building permit record in PLUS.

It allows for the continuation of installation without the necessity of a county inspector verifying wire size, type, conduit, depth, and number of conductors. \n\nExample: Electrical work in parking lots, ditches, trenches, concrete. \n\n_**NOTE** : The Electrical Underground Certification cannot be utilized for swimming pools and/or hazardous locations, as defined by the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code._  \n\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * Requirements\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## PLAN AHEAD\n\nBefore scheduling the final inspection, a Master Electrician must provide the Electrical Underground Certification for all electrical work done underground and not inspected by county inspectors. Failure to do so may result in a failed final inspection and the possibility of a re-inspection fee.\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Master Electrician will be responsible for certifying the electrical underground work. They must have the proper license and acknowledge that the installation was installed according to the construction documents. They also will acknowledge that they have read the current editions of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (VUSBC), National Electric Code (NEC), and Chapter 66 of the Code of the County of Fairfax.\n\n## HOW DO I SUBMIT MY RECORD?\n\n### **PLUS Application**\n\nOnce you have made the determination that an Electrical Underground Certification must be submitted, login to PLUS to make the request.

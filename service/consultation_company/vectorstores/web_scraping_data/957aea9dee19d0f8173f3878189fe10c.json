A record includes permits, plans and other miscellaneous project types.\n\n  \nLDS reviews site, subdivision and building plans, and issues all applicable site and building permits. LDS building and site records are applied for in PLUS. Below you will find a list of LDS record types available in PLUS along with the associated process requirements for that record. **If you are unsure whether you need a permit or not,** visit our When a Permit is Required page for more information.\n\nTo apply for a record, you will need to log into or create a PLUS account.

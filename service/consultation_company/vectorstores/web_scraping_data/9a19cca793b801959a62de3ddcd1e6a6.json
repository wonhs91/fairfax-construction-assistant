This item was added to the ZOWP in response to a follow-on motion approved by the Board following the adoption of the new Zoning Ordinance (zMOD). The ZOWP item called for the establishment of a stakeholder group of landscape professionals to discuss topics related to their operations that might make it difficult for them to find appropriate locations in the County to establish their businesses and whether the use standards related to the type of vehicles stored on the site could be modified to be less restrictive and open up opportunities for finding suitable locations.\n\n## Staff Report\n\nThe staff report for the Contractor\u2019s Office, Shop, and Construction Vehicles proposed Zoning Ordinance amendment is available for review ahead of the public hearings before the Planning Commission on 10/30 and Board of Supervisors on 12/3.\n\nView Staff REport\n\n### Related Resources\n\nBoard Matter & Resolution (9/24/2024)\n\nLand Use Policy Committee White Paper (7/16/2024) \n\nLand Use Policy Committee Presentation (7/23/2024) \n\n## \n\nCommunity Engagement\n\n##  Public Hearings \n\n**Planning Commission:** Wednesday**,** October 30, 2024 at 7:30 p.m. \n\n**Board of Supervisors:** Tuesday, December 3, 2024 at 4:30 p.m.\n\n##  Past Meetings and Materials \n\n**Meeting with Landscape Contractors and Professionals**  \nMonday, December 13, 2021\n\n* * *\n\n**Meeting with Landscape Contractors and Professionals**  \nWednesday, December 15, 2021\n\n* * *\n\n**Planning Commission\u2019s Land Use Process Review Committee**  \nThursday, May 12, 2022\n\nMeeting Video\n\n* * *\n\n**Board of Supervisor\u2019s Land Use Policy Committee**  \nTuesday, May 17, 2022\n\nMeeting Video | White Paper | Staff Presentation\n\n* * *\n\n**Community Lunch and Learn**  \nTuesday, March 5, 2024\n\nMeeting Video | Staff Presentation\n\n* * *\n\n**Community Meeting**  \nThursday, March 14, 2024\n\nMeeting Video | Staff Presentation\n\n* * *\n\n**Mount Vernon Council of Citizens\u2019 Associations**  \nMonday, April 1, 2024\n\n* * *\n\n**Mount Vernon Springfield Chamber of Commerce**   \nMonday, April 22, 2024 \n\n* * *\n\n**South County Federation**  \nTuesday, April 30, 2024\n\n* * *\n\n**Planning Commission\u2019s Land Use Process Review Committee**  \nThursday, May 9, 2024\n\nMeeting Video | Staff Presentation\n\n* * *\n\n**Board of Supervisors\u2019 Land Use Policy Committee**  \nTuesday, July 23, 2024\n\nMeeting Video | Meeting Materials\n\n* * *\n\n**Lunch and Learn**  \nThursday, September 5, 2024\n\nMeeting Video\n\n* * *\n\n**Community Meeting**  \nTuesday, September 10, 2024\n\n## Contact Us\n\nFor more information regarding this proposed Zoning Ordinance amendment, and to share your feedback on the draft text, please contact Austin Gastrell, Zoning Administration Division, by email or at (703) 324-1314.\n\n  \n\n",

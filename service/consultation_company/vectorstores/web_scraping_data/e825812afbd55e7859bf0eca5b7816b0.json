Required plans and documents are submitted in the PLUS Digital Plan Room (DPR).\n\nDuring the review process, county plan reviewers may identify **issues** which require corrections. Issues are comments from reviewers which require an **applicant response** before resubmitting. Additionally, any issues requiring modifications must have the necessary revised plan and/or document uploaded before completing the resubmission. If corrections are required, the applicant will receive an email with links and instructions to resubmit the requested documents/plans. Any applicable resubmission fees must also be paid _**prior to**_ completing your resubmission to prevent unnecessary processing delays.\n\nBelow are instructions for using the Digital Plan Room to address corrections in PLUS. You may also view helpful videos on the resubmission process on the county\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nMore information on PLUS.\n\n  * 1\\. Pay Re-submission Fee\n  * 2\\. Respond to Issues\n  * 3\\.

PLUS will scan each sheet for title information and assign a sheet number if one can be found. If one is not recognized by the system, you will have to manually enter the sheet number. Additionally, each page must have a unique sheet number and will need to be manually corrected if duplicated. An optional sheet title can be entered for each sheet.\n\n**_Note: Sheet versioning is a very important step when submitting corrected plan sheets as the sheet number will establish the relationship between the previous versions of a sheet and the updated sheet. The sheet number given to the updated sheet must be the same as the previous version for the system to recognize the relationship between the sheets. If there is no sheet displayed in the Previous Version thumbnail, it is because the sheet number changed between versions. The sheet number should be manually changed to the correct number to match the original._**\n\nIf the sheet number is not the same, there will be no previous version showing in the thumbnail on the right. To manually search for the correct sheet number, click on the search (magnifying glass) icon and click **Select** next to the appropriate sheet.\n\nOnce all individual sheets are numbered correctly click **Continue** to proceed to Step 4.\n\nReview \n\nThis is your final opportunity to review your review package prior to submission.

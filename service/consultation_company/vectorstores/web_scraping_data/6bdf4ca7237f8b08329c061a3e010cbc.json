It is focused on facilitating an environment of enhanced communication and cooperation among all project stakeholders. **The program\u2019s key components for success are mutual accountability in communications, quality and schedule**.\n\nThe Project Management Program offers two types of services:\n\n  * Longer-term project management, which runs through the entire land development process\n  * Briefer commitments, known as troubleshooting or liaison services, to assist with a specific project milestone or permit approvals\n\n\n\nWith either approach, a project manager coordinates closely with the applicant\u2019s team and the county staff involved in plan review, permit issuance and inspections to foster high-quality submittals, prompt and proactive communications, and close collaboration to achieve established goals. Each project is different and the scope of services will be established with the applicant upon applying and receiving acceptance into this program. The Project Management Program also coordinates with Building Division project managers who specifically guide projects through the building plan review and inspections phase.\n\nWe invite you to examine the criteria to evaluate project acceptance in the program. Should you feel that your project is a good fit, please feel free to apply for project management services. Please consult our FAQs for answers to commonly asked questions, read our testimonials to learn about past projects, and see our dashboard for a list of current projects. Should you need additional information or have questions regarding the program, please email or call Helman Castro, Director of Operations, at Helman.Castro@Fairfaxcounty.gov; **703-324-1780, TTY 711**.\n\nMeet the team.\n\nhttps://cs.ebmcdn.net/eastbay-live-hs-1/mediacache/_definst_/mp4:vod/fairfax/flash/CC0618_land_development.mp4/playlist.m3u8   \n  \nor  \n  \nhttps://cs.ebmcdn.net/eastbay-live-hs-1/mediacache/_definst_/mp4:vod/fairfax/flash/CC0618_land_development.mp4/manifest.mpd \n",

Most alternate construction methods can be reviewed and approved through the code modification process on a case by case basis. However, materials and products have more specific functions and require greater scrutiny and review.\n\nTo assist in that level of review, the county relies on nationally-recognized evaluation services and their corresponding evaluation reports. The reports give instruction to the designer, plan reviewer, builder and inspector for the proper installation and code applicability. The county accepts reports from the following agencies:\n\n  * International Code Council \u2013 Evaluation Service\n  * IAPMO Uniform Evaluation Service\n  * Intertek\n  * Architectural Testing, Inc. (now a subsidiary of Intertek)\n  * Dr. J Engineering\n\n\n\nIf you wish to use a product in your project, ensure it has an evaluation report from one of the agencies listed above that references Virginia\u2019s current building code, the preceding code or any future code. Please note that the requirements in the report must be strictly following during permit application and installation. Pay particular attention to a section in the report titled, \u201cConditions of Use.\u201d Plan review staff ensure all applicable conditions are incorporated in the construction plans or are part of the submission package.\n\n  \nNeed Help? Call **703-222-0801** , **TTY 711**.\n\nMonday through Thursday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Friday from 9:15 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n  * LDS Permit Library: Access guides to navigate every record type in PLUS.\n  * Letters to Industry: Subscribe for LDS announcements, notices, and tech bulletins.\n  * Meet With Staff: Find a staff member to help you with the permit process.\n\n\n",

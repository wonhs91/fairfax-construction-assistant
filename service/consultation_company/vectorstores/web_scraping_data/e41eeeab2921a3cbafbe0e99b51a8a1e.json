The Fairfax County Comprehensive Plan is evaluated more frequently to manage the dynamic changes in the County and to conduct Plan maintenance. Plan amendments are initiated by a motion by the Board of Supervisors. In order for an amendment to be adopted, it must be the subject of a public hearing before the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors.\n\n## Plan Amendment Work Program\n\nThe Comprehensive Plan Amendment (PA) Work Program lists authorized current and future planning studies and amendments. The work program consists of activity center and neighborhood planning studies, and site-specific (Board-authorized) and countywide policy amendments. Priority is given to amendments that advance major policy objectives, address emerging community concerns, and provide a platform to better implement the Concept for Future Development. The planning process strives to identify the latest planning trends, engage the community in planning efforts, and ensure that plan guidance is up to date and relevant to decision makers.\n\nView 2023 Comprehensive PA Work Program\n\n## Current Plan Amendme\u200c\u200cnts and Studies\n\nProject websites have been established to provide additional information about specific studies.\n\n  * Minor Plan Amendments\n  * Activity Center or Neighborhood\n  * Countywide and Policy\n\n\n\nView Current Plan Amendments & Studies\n\n## Site-Specific Plan Amendment (SSPA) Process\u200c\u200c\n\n\u200c\u200cThe Site-Specific Plan Amendment process (SSPA) improves public participation in land use planning efforts, and allows for the community to propose changes to the Work Program.

The time limits and grandfathering provisions in the stormwater ordinance allow certain plans, in limited situations, to be designed to the old technical criteria, as specified in the Virginia Stormwater Regulations. The SWOD requests allow for determination of the project\u2019s Time Limits or grandfathering status in advance of formal plan submission; however, in lieu of a separate determination request, applicants may elect to include the determination request in the plan or as an attachment to a plan submission.  \n\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## **WHO SHOULD APPLY?**\n\nProperty owners or their duly authorized agents may submit a stormwater ordinance determination request.\n\n  * Verify License on DPOR Website\n  * Hiring a Contractor\n\n\n\n## **PLAN AHEAD**\n\nBefore submitting, ensure you are aware of all applicable regulations and conditions that could affect your project to avoid surprises during the review process.

These permits require one inspection. Fuel-fired appliances are included under the Household Appliance permit type. Please note, if you are installing new gas piping with an appliance, apply for a Residential Plumbing permit, not a Household Appliance permit.\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## WHO SHOULD APPLY?\n\nProperty owners may obtain permits in their own name, however, it is strongly recommended a properly licensed contractor pull the permits as the responsible party so the county can better assist in gaining compliance for defective work.\n\n  * Hiring a Contractor\n  * Verify License on DPOR Website\n\n\n\n## PLAN AHEAD\n\nBefore submitting, ensure you are aware of all applicable regulations and conditions that could affect your project to avoid surprises during the review process.

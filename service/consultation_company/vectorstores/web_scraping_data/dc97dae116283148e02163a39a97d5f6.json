This service is provided as part of the Project Management Program.\n\nCRDs were established to encourage economic development activities in older commercial areas of the county. The purpose of these designations is to encourage the improved economic viability, appearance and function of the designated areas through new quality development, rehabilitation and/or redevelopment by providing for specific regulations designed to facilitate the redevelopment of these areas.\n\nThe CRD coordinator is available as an additional resource to applicants during the development process by serving as a point of contact to the applicant and their design team. The coordinator can assist in answering questions, providing key points of contact for various phases of the process, help resolving questions or issues that may arise involving multiple reviewers or agencies, and follow up on the status of project tasks to ensure the process is progressing efficiently.\n\nYou can get acquainted with the development process by reviewing our overview and find more specific information from the following Related Information. \n\n## Related Information\n\n  * Development Process Overview\n  * ePlans for Building and Site Plans \n  * Community Revitalization Section of the Department of Planning and Development\n  * CRD Zoning Ordinance Regulations\n  * Virginia Existing Building Code\n  * Fast Track Building Plan Review\n  * Modified Processing\n  * Revitalization and the Building Permit Process\n  * Expedited Building Plan Review through the use of Peer Reviewers\n  * Commercial Interior Alterations\n  * Post Disaster Recovery Process\n  * Off-Street Parking Requirements\n  * CRD Urban Design Guidelines\n  * Public Facilities Manual\n\n\n",

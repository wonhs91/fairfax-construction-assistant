Each amendment is unique and involves different levels of engagement. Outreach can occur in a variety of forms, including surveys, community meetings, targeted stakeholder working groups, and Facebook Live events. The following are just a few of the ways to stay engaged and involved.\n\n  * 1\\. Zoning Ordinance Announcements\n  * 2\\. Proposed & Recently Adopted Amendments\n  * 3\\. Land Use Planning & Zoning Facebook Page\n  * 4\\. Zoning Open Houses\n\n\n\n__Print Section\n\n__Print All Sections\n\nZoning Ordinance Announcements \n\nTo receive periodic announcements about proposed and adopted Zoning Ordinance amendments and other zoning administration topics, subscribe to the **Zoning Ordinance Information and Amendments** e-mail listserv.\n\nSubscribe to Email Updates\n\nProposed & Recently Adopted Amendments \n\nAmendments that have been authorized for public hearings or are under consideration are located on the Proposed Zoning Ordinance Amendments webpage. This page includes a brief description of the amendment, as well as any scheduled public hearing dates. It also includes links to specific web pages for the proposed amendments where more detailed information is available.\n\nOnce an amendment is adopted by the Board of Supervisors, information is available on the Recently Adopted Amendments webpage. This page includes links to the adopted text, as well as any amendment-specific websites.\n\nLand Use Planning & Zoning Facebook Page \n\nThe Fairfax County Land Use Planning & Zoning Facebook page provides regular updates on ongoing amendments and any other relevant land use news, such as recently approved zoning cases. Outreach events are often recorded via Facebook Live, and citizens are encouraged to participate in the meetings remotely. After the meeting, the videos are posted to the Facebook page for those who wish to share or watch the meetings at a later date. Click \u201clike\u201d or \u201cfollow\u201d to stay up-to-date.\n\nZoning Open Houses \n\nEvery summer, the Zoning Administration Division showcases ongoing or recently adopted Zoning Ordinance Amendments at an open house. It\u2019s a great opportunity to learn about proposals and to meet your zoning staff.\n\nView the 2019 South County Zoning Open House Presentation\n\nPrevious:  Next: Zoning Ordinance Announcements\n",

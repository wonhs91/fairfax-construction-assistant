These tests must be performed and submitted before the final inspection to provide an opportunity for the permit holder to correct any deficiencies found during testing. The test requirements can be found in Chapter 11: Energy Efficiency of the Virginia Residential Code.\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## WHO SHOULD APPLY?\n\nContacts listed on the original residential building (BLDR) permit record in PLUS may submit an air/duct leakage test amendment record in PLUS.

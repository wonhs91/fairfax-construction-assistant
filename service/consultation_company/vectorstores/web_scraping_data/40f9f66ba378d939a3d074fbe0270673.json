These requests may include use determinations, questions on the placement or use of buildings or structures, and a variety of other zoning-related questions. \n\n**Before submitting a request**\n\nHave you called our Planner of the Day (POD)? Many questions do not require an interpretation and can be answered over the phone by our POD staff at 703-324-1314 or by email at ORDAdmin@fairfaxcounty.gov. If you have basic questions on what a use may be, applicable yards or setback requirements, if a proposed use or structure is allowed in a specific zoning district and under what permissions, and other general zoning-related questions, please contact our POD. \n\n## HOW TO SUBMIT A REQUEST\n\nAll requests for an interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance must be submitted electronically through the PLUS application portal.\n\nFor additional information on how to use the PLUS application portal, please visit the DPD PLUS Information & Support page.

In many cases a contractor will be used by the owner to complete this process. Once the inspection is complete, and a damage assessment report has been issued by LDS, the structure will be released to the owner of the property, or to the contractor, so the damage can be repaired.\n\nIf you have experienced property damage due to natural disaster or structural impacts, please email LDS to request an inspection and a damage assessment report.\n\n**Please note:** If the property sustains fire damage or hazardous materials are released, Fairfax County Fire and Rescue investigators may do the damage assessment report.\n\nSee the step-by-step process and additional resources in the Post-Disaster Recovery fact sheet.\n\n## Inspection Scheduling\n\n  * Building- and Trade-Related Inspections\n  * Residential Use Permit (RUP) _or Certificate of Occupancy_\n  * Fire Marshal Inspections: \n    * Installation of Fire Protection Systems - submit the Acceptance Inspection/Test Request form by email\n    * Scheduling of Pre-occupancy inspections - submit through the PLUS Citizen Portal via the Occupancy Inspection record\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n## Staff is Available for Assistance\n\n  * **Zoning Permits** (Plats, Permit Review, Occupancy, Home Occupations) **703-222-1082, TTY 711**\n  * **Zoning Administration** (Zoning & Noise Ordinance Questions, Appeals, Signs) **703-324-1314, TTY 711**\n  * **Zoning Evaluation** (Zoning Applications, Staff Reports) **703-324-1290, TTY 711**\n  * **Planning Division** (Comprehensive Plan) **703-324-1380, TTY 711**\n  * **Site and Subdivision Plans** **703-324-2268, TTY 711**\n  * **Building Permits** **703-222-0801, TTY 711**\n  * Planner of the Day\n  * **Office of the Fire Marshal, Acceptance Testing** **703-246-4821, TTY 711**\n  * **Office of the Fire Marshal, Fire Inspections Branch** **703-246-4849, TTY 711**\n\n\n\nDevelopment Agencies Contact Information\n\n  \n\n\n6\\.

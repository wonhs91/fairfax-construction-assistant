As a result, there are regulations which address the clearing of land, the dumping of fill dirt and debris such as stumps and trash, and the erosion of soil.\n\n  * Clearing of areas greater than 2,500 square feet or cut and fill in depths of 18 inches and greater requires a permit. \n  * Clearing of even small areas within a flood plain requires a permit or letter of permission.\n\n\n\nVisit Online Building and Land Development Information to find permit information on a particular address or area. \n\n# Clues to Illegal Activity and Construction Problems\n\n  * The activity is occurring before 7 a.m. or after 7 p.m. or on weekends.\n  * No company name appears on the construction vehicles or equipment.\n  * Construction activity is occurring on a site with no advertising sign.\n  * Land is being cleared without surveyor's flagging on trees.\n  * There is no construction entrance adjacent to the roadway (an area of large stone and gravel placed to keep mud off of streets).\n\n\n\nIf you observe illegal activities, you should report it to the appropriate agency during normal business hours.\n\n**Issue** | **Agency** | **Telephone** | **Electronic**  \n---|---|---|---  \nIllegal land clearing and tree removal | Code Enforcement Branch | **703-324-1300, TTY 711** | online  \nTrees that are a public hazard | Forest Conservation Branch | **703-324-1720, TTY 711** | email  \nTree problems in Fairfax County parks | Fairfax County Park Authority | **703-324-8594, TTY 703-324-3988** | email  \nTree problems adjacent to public roads and streets | Virginia Department of Transportation | **800-367-7623, TTY 711** | online  \nSoil eroding onto adjacent land  | Site Development and Inspection Division | **703-324-7470, TTY 711** | online  \nSoil eroding into streams and bodies of water | Site Development and Inspection Division | **703-324-7470, TTY 711** | online  \nSoil erosion on private property (non-construction sites) | Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District | **703-324-1460, TTY 711** | email  \nIllegal filling or soil removal activities | Code Enforcement Branch | **703-324-1300, TTY 711** | email  \nIllegal dumping of debris that may cause health hazards | Health Department | **703-246-2300, TTY 703-591-6435** | email  \nIllegal dumping of hazardous waste into storm drains, streams, etc. | Fire Marshal | **703-246-4386, TTY 703-335-4419** | email  \nDust problems | Site Development and Inspection Division | **703-324-7470, TTY 711** | online  \nMud on streets from construction | Site Development and Inspection Division | **703-324-7470, TTY 711** | online  \nNoise problems between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. | Department of Code Compliance | **703-324-1300, TTY 711** | online  \n  \n  \nNeed Help?

The prison facility closed in 2001 and the following year it was part of a 2,440-acre land purchase by Fairfax County from the federal government. Pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the federal government entered into a legally binding Memorandum of Agreement with Fairfax County and other interested parties to preserve the historically significant buildings and structures on the Campus in a manner that favors adaptive reuse. Today, the property is referred to as \"Laurel Hill,\" in commemoration of the 18th century structure on the site, which served as the home of revolutionary war patriot William Lindsay.\n\n##  Background \n\n  * From Lorton to Laurel Hill (Video)\n  * History and Land Transfer \n  * Historical Documents, Plans, Drawings\n  * National Register Historic District \n\n\n\n##  Adaptive Reuse Area \n\n  * Adaptive Reuse Area Overview (Video)\n  * Comprehensive Agreement\n  * Draft Architectural Standards and Guidelines\n  * Illustrative Plan - Site Layout\n  * Master Plan\n\n\n\n##  Additional Resources \n\n  * Laurel Hill House\n  * Maps\n  * Physicians Residence\n\n\n\n##  Workhouse Campus \n\n  * Laurel Hill Workhouse Campus\n  * Frequently Asked Questions\n  * Photo Gallery\n  * Request for Expressions of Interest\n\n\n",

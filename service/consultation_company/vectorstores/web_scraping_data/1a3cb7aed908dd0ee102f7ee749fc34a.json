An application must be submitted in PLUS for consideration. FAC staff verifies that all requirements of your request have been completed and submits your request for approval to the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors.  \n\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## **WHO SHOULD APPLY?**\n\nProperty owner(s) of an existing named street may submit a request to change the name of a street. All requests must be approved by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. Submitting a street name change request is a commitment by all affected parties to change the street name on which their property is addressed. If the proposed street name is approved, the address of each property will be changed, and all owners will be impacted. Affected property owners are responsible for notifying personal correspondents and will bear all expenses incurred due to changing personal and business information. This information includes required address numbers on dwellings and mailboxes, street signs, driver\u2019s licenses, debtors, banks, legal documents, and more.\n\n## **PLAN AHEAD**\n\nBefore submitting, ensure you are aware of all applicable regulations and conditions that could affect your project to avoid surprises during the review process. Some of those factors include:\n\n  * Where to find addressing details in the county code, Chapter 102.\n  * Accessing the county\u2019s Master Address Repository (MAR) to confirm whether your requested address already exists.\n  * Use the county\u2019s The Validator application to verify your address.\n  * Accessing more information about your property via our Property Information webpage.\n  * Accessing the county\u2019s Real Estate Assessment page (icare) to find more details on your specific property.\n\n\n\nWant to review frequently asked questions and detailed processing maps?

You will be notified of any deficiencies. Plan corrections, resubmission fees and additional supporting documents may be required. FAC staff will coordinate submission of your review package to the Board of Supervisors (BOS). Your package will be added as a Board Item to the next meeting agenda, which is when the BOS will hear your request and make a decision.\n\n  * Queue Times\n  * Fees\n  * Workflow Routing Slip to track review and plan assignment\n\n\n\n_For a detailed summary of application progress, to include the name(s) of assigned review staff, click on \u201c**Reports** \u201d in the top-right corner of the PLUS screen, when you are in a specific record, and select \u201c**Workflow Routing Slip Report**.\u201d_\n\n### Approval Letter Issuance\n\nIf the BOS approves your street name change petition, you will receive an approval notification via email containing a link to download your approved board package and approval letter. GIS will then update the county\u2019s mapping systems and Master Address Repository (MAR) with the new addresses and street name. Next, MAR will send your new address to all other systems, such as PLUS and iCare. You will be able to see your new address in MAR and PLUS the following business day, however, other county systems could take up to a week to fully update.\n\nEvery week, FAC staff issues a report of all new and expired addresses. This report is sent to all county agencies, including Public Safety (or 911), and the U.S. Postal Service. Your approval letter may be used immediately to update personal correspondents, which may include utility companies, telephone companies, banks, and other personal accounts.\n\n## **Additional Resources**\n\n  * Sign Shop Price List\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n### **Need More Assistance?**\n\nFor questions or additional information, please visit the Facilitation and Addressing Center website or via telephone at 703-222-0801, TTY 711.\n\n  \n\n\nBack to Top\n\n### Was this guide helpful?

Pursuant to Zoning Ordinance subsection 5105.2.A, the director of Land Development Services must review all proposed uses and development to determine whether the land on which the proposed use or development is located is within a floodplain and if so, will determine whether the proposed use or development may be permitted in accordance with county floodplain regulations.\n\n  \nDepending on the scope of your project, you may need to apply for a separate building permit record in PLUS. To determine whether your project requires a permit, visit When a Permit is Required. Once you determine the appropriate record type, review the associated Permit Library guide to find details regarding the submission and review process.\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\n  * Who Should Apply?\n  * Plan Ahead\n  * How Do I Submit My Record?\n\n\n\n  * Requirements\n  * What's Next?\n  * Additional Resources\n\n\n\n_This information is the most common for how to obtain the necessary approval for your project and is not representative of all the conditions you may encounter._\n\n## **WHO SHOULD APPLY?**\n\nProperty owners or their duly authorized agents may submit a floodplain use determination request.\n\n  * Verify License on DPOR Website\n  * Hiring a Contractor\n\n\n\n## **PLAN AHEAD**\n\nBefore submitting, ensure you are aware of all applicable regulations and conditions that could affect your project to avoid surprises during the review process.

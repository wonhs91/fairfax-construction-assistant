Backflow occurs when the water direction in a plumbing system flows backwards creating the potential for a contaminate to enter our public water system. Backflow prevention can be achieved through the use of backflow assemblies, devices or methods.\n\nFairfax County\u2019s Land Development Services and Fairfax Water work together to safeguard the water supply through implementation and monitoring of the Cross Connections Control and Backflow Prevention Program to identify hazards and ensure testing is conducted as required. Backflow prevention assemblies are required by the building code to be tested annually by a certified tester.\n\n## Resources\n\n  * Customer Resources\n  * Vendor Resources\n\n\n\n  * Customer Experience Survey\n  * Lookup Your Map Grid\n  * Authorized Vendor List - Cross Connections\n  * When Testing is Due (By Map Grid)\n\n\n\n  * Fairfax Water Cross-Connection Control Program Manual\n  * Download Test Report by Record ID\n  * Authorized Vendor Application\n  * Subscribe to Vendor Notifications\n  * Download Test Report by Address\n  * Fillable Backflow Assembly Test Report for New Locations\n  * Download Test Report by Property Name\n\n\n\n## \n\n##  Cross Connection Program Notifications \n\n  * Contractor and/or Building Owner Responsible for Residential Sprinkler System\n  * DPOR Certification for Backflow Prevention Device Workers\n  * Fairfax Water Cross-Connection Control Program Manual\n\n\n\n## Download Test Report\n\nLocate and download your pre-filled Backflow Assembly Test Report.\n\n  * Locate Current Backflow Assembly Test Report\n\n\n\n## Submit Test Reports\n\nPlease review the requirements and responsibilities prior to submitting your test report.\n\n  * Backflow Assembly Test Report Submission\n\n\n\n## Update Contact\n\nIt is your responsibility to inform the county of a change in ownership or responsible party.\n\n  * Update Property Owner/Owner Agent Contact Information\n\n\n\n## Register Your Residential Lawn Irrigation or Fire Suppression System\n\nIf your property has a lawn irrigation system or water-based fire suppression system, please ensure it is registered with Fairfax County.\n\n  * Registration Form\n\n\n\n## Requirements and Responsibilities\n\nThere are minimum requirements for the installation and testing of backflow preventers.

These sites and buildings also tell the history of the built environment in the county, which includes Native American hunting camps and long-term settlements, the tidewater plantations of George Washington and George Mason, Civil and Spanish-American War campsites and training grounds, as well as the 20th century planned town of Reston and its 19th century counterpart Dunn Loring. Recording, preserving, and studying this evidence enriches the quality of life in Fairfax County by putting residents in touch with their heritage, providing residents and property owners with a sense of temporal stability and continuity, and instilling in both young and old a loyalty and commitment to place and community. This public stewardship responsibility has been recognized for over thirty years and continues today.\n\n## Architectural Review Board\n\nThe ARB is responsible for public interest(s) as embodied in the Historic Overlay District Ordinance. Its job is to protect and enhance the resources that give a district its historic, architectural, or archaeological significance.\n\n  * Learn More\n\n\n\n## History Commission\n\nThe Fairfax County History Commission, advises the County Government, and promotes and encourages public interest in all matters bearing on the history of Fairfax County, and helps identify, document, record and preserve our County's historic past here in Northern Virginia.\n\n  * Learn More\n\n\n\n## Preservation Easements\n\nThe Easements Program is committed to helping owners protect open space, historic resources, scenic vistas, and sensitive natural areas on their property, enabling these resources to remain in private ownership.\n\n  * Learn More\n\n\n\n## Historic Overlay Districts\n\nHistoric Overlay Districts provide regulations over and above the regular zoning protection to better protect those unique areas, sites, and buildings that are of special architectural, historic, or archaeological value to local residents and visitors.\n\n  * Learn More\n\n\n\n## Inventory of Historic Sites\n\nThe Fairfax County Inventory of Historic Sites was established in 1969.

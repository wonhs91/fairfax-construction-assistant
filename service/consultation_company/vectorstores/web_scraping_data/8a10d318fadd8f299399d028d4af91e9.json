Journeyman and Masters (electricians, plumbers or mechanical contractors) can do work under $1,000 per contract without a state contractor\u2019s license. Contractors, Journeymen, and Masters are licensed through the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation (DPOR). Read through all the information below for more details.\n\n**Contractor licenses** consist of two parts: The **class** of license (A, B or C), which determines the monetary value of contracts/projects that may be performed, and the **classification/specialty** , which determines what type of work is allowed. The classification or specialty defines the scope of practice that may be performed by the licensed contractor. You may find a list of all of the different classifications and specialties issued by the Board for Contractors and a definition of the work that is permitted to be performed by each, in 18VAC50-22-20 and 18VAC50-22-30 of the Board for Contractors Regulations.\n\nAll businesses operating in Virginia must register with the State Corporation Commission (SCC). Trade names are also registered with the SCC.\n\n## Department of Professional And Occupational Regulation (DPOR)\n\nPerimeter Center  \nSuite 102 (first floor)  \n9960 Mayland Drive  \nRichmond, VA 23233  \n(804) 367-8511  \ncontractor@dpor.virginia.gov  \nwww.dpor.virginia.gov\n\n  \n\n\nThese are the required steps/permits necessary to perform contracting work in Fairfax County:  \n\n\n## State and Local Licenses\n\nBECOME A LICENSED CONTRACTOR THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA\n\nRead more on the DPOR website.\n\nThe Board for Contractors issues licenses in one of three classes: Class \u201cA\u201d, Class \u201cB\u201d and Class \u201cC\u201d.

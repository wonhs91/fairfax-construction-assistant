An approved agency responsible for laboratory testing or special inspections, or both, is required.\n  * Determine whether the Special Inspections (SI) program applies to your project. \n    * The Structural Engineer of Record, the Architect of Record, or the Building Plan reviewer will determine the required Special Inspections for your project.\n  * When applying for a CRIT record, you will be asked to provide the email addresses, company names, mailing address, phone number and license numbers for the following: \n    * Structural Engineer of record (SER),\n    * Special Inspection engineer of record (SIER),\n    * Owner representative,\n    * General Contractor (GC)\n  * Use the GIS Critical Structures Section Inspection Areas to track who your designated critical structure inspector is, based on your address.\n  * Types of Soils and Problem Soils\n  * Design codes and standards\n\n\n\nTo get a detailed description about additional regulations and conditions beyond what is listed above, visit our Plan Ahead page.\n\n## TYPICAL CRITICAL STRUCTURE PROCESS FLOWCHART\n\n### \n\n## HOW DO I SUBMIT MY RECORD?\n\n### **PLUS Application**\n\nApply for your **Critical Structure (CRIT)** record online in PLUS to obtain your CRIT record number, then complete the online Critical Structure Meeting request form. \n\nWhen applying for the CRIT record in PLUS, under the building tab, search for your building record number.

You will receive an acceptance email.\n\n### Critical Structure (CS) Meeting\n\nOnce your Critical Structure Meeting request has been submitted, you will be contacted by county staff to confirm the date and time for a virtual Microsoft Teams meeting.\n\nDuring the meeting the involved entities will be verified, the Special Inspection (SI) items will be finalized, and DocuSign emails will be circulated among the appropriate parties for their signatures on the Statement of Special Inspection (SSI) form.\n\nWhen all parties have signed the Statement of Special Inspection form, the Statement of Special Inspection form will be emailed to the signatories. The status of the CRIT record will be updated to \u201cIn Progress\u201d (Document Review).\n\n### Special Inspection Document Review\n\nOnce the permit is issued, you may be required to submit approved Special Inspection documents (shop drawings and other Special Inspection related submittals) to the Critical Structures team.\n\nYou must upload these documents in a CRIT record and email it to the designated County Critical Structure Engineer.\n\nFollowing the completion of this review, the documents will be returned to the applicant with a County Review Stamp.\n\n### Inspections\n\nOnce construction has begun, all the Special Inspection items mentioned in the approved Statement of Special Inspection form are inspected by the registered professional Engineer or a testing agency. \n\nThe reports and test results of the inspections are then required to be submitted to the county in a timely manner.\n\nThese reports must be uploaded in the CRIT record and emailed to the designated county Critical Structures Engineer.\n\n### Close Out\n\nWhen all the items identified on the Statement of Special Inspection form have passed inspection and a Special Inspection Final Report is submitted to the county, the applicant is required to notify the designated county Critical Structure Engineer.\n\nThe Critical Structures team will review and approve the Special Inspection Final Report and close out the CRIT record.\n\nOnce this happens, the Special Inspection requirements for the building permit Final Inspection are met.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n  * Expedited Plan Review/Peer Review\n  * Project Management Program\n  * Special Inspections Program\n  * Green Building Priority Review\n\n\n\n### **Need More Assistance?**\n\nFor questions or additional information, please contact staff via telephone at 703-222-0801, TTY 711.\n\nBack to Top\n\n### Was this guide helpful?

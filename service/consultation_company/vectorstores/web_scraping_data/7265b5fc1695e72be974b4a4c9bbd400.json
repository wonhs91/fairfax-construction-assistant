A recess is generally taken in August/September and in late December/early January. Board of Zoning Appeals meetings are aired live on the County government's cable TV Channel 16, streamed online, and over the phone at 703-324-7700. Archived video of previous BZA meetings are also available for viewing on demand.\n\nThe agendas for the Fairfax County Board of Zoning Appeals are posted to this page approximately 20 days prior to the hearing date and are then updated after the meeting has taken place. Please contact the clerk's office to verify whether any changes have occurred after the posting.\n\n## Public Testimony\n\n  * Sign Up to Speak\n  * Provide Written Comment\n\n\n\nIf you wish to speak at a BZA meeting, it is recommended that you sign up ahead of time using the BZA Speaker Sign Up form. Testimony may be in person or via pre-submitted video. \n\nAll public hearings are held at:\n\nBoard Auditorium  \nFairfax County Government Center  \n12000 Government Center Parkway  \nFairfax, VA 22035\n\nIf you wish to provide written comment for a hearing, it can be emailed to BZAClerkMail@FairfaxCounty.gov or mailed to Clerk to the Board of Zoning Appeals, 12055 Government Center Parkway, Suite 801, Fairfax, VA 22035. To ensure that information submitted concerning applications currently pending before the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) will be included with the Board package materials distributed to the BZA members, the information **must be received prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Tuesday one week before the meeting** at which the application is scheduled. Any emails/correspondence received after that time up to 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday the day before a hearing will be distributed to the Board members the evening before or morning of the hearing.\n\nAny correspondence received after the deadlines will not be distributed to the BZA members or included as part of the official record once a final decision is made on an application. If a hearing is continued, deferred, or decision deferred to another date, any correspondence that was received after the initial deadlines, but before the new deadlines of the date the hearing was moved to, will become part of the permanent file.\n\n## \n\n2024 Meeting Dates and Agendas\n\n##  January 2024 \n\nJanuary 3, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\nJanuary 10, 2024\n\nJanuary 17, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\nJanuary 24, 2024\n\nJanuary 31, 2024\n\n##  February 2024 \n\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\nFebruary 14, 2024\n\nFebruary 21, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\nFebruary 28, 2024 \n\n##  March 2024 \n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\nMarch 27, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\n##  April 2024 \n\nApril 3, 2024 \n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nApril 17, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n##  May 2024 \n\nMay 1, 2024\n\nMay 8, 2024\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nMay 22, 2024\n\nMay 29, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\n##  June 2024 \n\nJune 5, 2024\n\nJune 12, 2024\n\nJune 19, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\nJune 26, 2024\n\n##  July 2024 \n\nJuly 3, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nJuly 17, 2024\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nJuly 31, 2024\n\n##  August 2024 \n\n**August Recess \u2013 August 7, 2024 - August 28, 2024**\n\n##  September 2024 \n\nSeptember 4, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\nSeptember 11, 2024\n\nSeptember 18, 2024\n\nSeptember 25, 2024\n\n##  October 2024 \n\nOctober 2, 2024\n\nOctober 9, 2024\n\nOctober 16, 2024\n\nOctober 23, 2024\n\nOctober 30, 2024\n\n##  November 2024 \n\nNovember 6, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\nNovember 13, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\nNovember 20, 2024\n\nNovember 27, 2024 - **No Meeting Scheduled**\n\n##  December 2024 \n\nDecember 4, 2024\n\n**Winter Break: December 11, 2024 - December 25, 2024**\n\n**View Previous Years BZA Meeting Agendas**\n\n## BZA Inclement Weather Policy\n\nIn the event of inclement weather, the County Executive may close all county offices or may grant unscheduled leave to county employees.

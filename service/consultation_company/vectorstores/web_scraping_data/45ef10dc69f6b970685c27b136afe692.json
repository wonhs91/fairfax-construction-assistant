This is a bi-annual, countywide cycle for reviewing site-specific proposals, called nominations, to change the Comprehensive Plan\u2019s land use recommendations. The Comprehensive Plan is the guiding document for land use and development decisions in Fairfax County and sets forth the community\u2019s vision for the future. With the property owner's consent, anyone can submit a proposal for site-specific land use changes.\n\n## 2025 Countywide SSPA Process\n\nThe 2025 Countywide Site-Specific Plan Amendment nomination period is anticipated to start accepting nominations in January 2025. Nominations will be submitted via PLUS. An updated 2025 Countywide SSPA guide, overall schedule, and an instructional video of how to submit a nomination in PLUS will be available soon.\n\n## Past SSPA Cycles\n\n2017 North County SSPA\n\n2019-2020 South County SSPA\n\n2022-2023 Countywide SSPA\n\n## Get Involved!\n\nLearn how to participate in the Site-Specific Plan Amendment (SSPA) Process.\n\n  * Learn More\n\n\n\n## FAQs\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about the SSPA Process.\n\n  * Learn More\n\n\n\n## Stay Informed\n\nTo receive timely announcements about the SSPA process, as well as announcements related to the Comprehensive Plan and plan amendments, subscribe to the Comprehensive Plan Announcements email list.\n\nSubscribe to Email Updates\n\n  \n\n",

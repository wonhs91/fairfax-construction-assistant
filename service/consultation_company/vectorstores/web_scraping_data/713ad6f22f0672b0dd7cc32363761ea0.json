Such application is also subject to Sect. 15.2-2232 of the Code of Virginia. The AREP application combines the zoning reviews and the reviews required under Sect. 15-2-2232.\n\n**AREPs are subject to the following:**\n\n  * Must not exceed 50 feet above ground level.\n  * New AREPs with attached wireless facilities must be located at least 300 feet from any other existing, or permitted but unconstructed, utility distribution or transmission pole if located in a residential zoning district. In all other zoning districts new AREPs must be located at least 100 feet from any other existing, or permitted but unconstructed, utility distribution or transmission pole. New AREPs proposed to be located within the boundaries of a local historic district must be referred to the Architectural Review Board (ARB) for its review and recommendation. The ARB may also assist the Zoning Administrator with her review of new AREPs proposed to locate within a Virginia Byway or on property that is both adjacent to a Virginia Byway and listed on the County Inventory of Historic Sites. \n  * All new AREPs must conform to requirements set forth in the Fairfax County Zoning Ordinance, applicable Policy Plan guidance, the urban design guidelines in the Comprehensive Plan, and any applicable area urban design guidelines.\n  * Applicants must provide documentation of the property owner\u2019s permission to install a new structure. For new AREPs proposed to locate on Fairfax County Park Authority properties, contact the Park Planning & Development Division at 703-324-8741. For facilities proposed to locate on school properties, contact Fairfax County Public Schools.\n\n\n\n## HOW TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION\n\nAll AREP applications must be submitted electronically through the PLUS application portal. Please review the Steps to Submit Public Facility Applications in PLUS for instructions. \n\nFor additional information on how to use the PLUS application portal, please visit the DPD PLUS Information & Support page.

Fees are paid electronically at the end of the application submission process. A service charge of 2.35% will be added to all fees paid with a credit card. \n  * Fairfax County must approve or disapprove the project application within 90 days of receipt of the complete application. Within 10 days after receipt of an application with a valid electronic mail address for the applicant, County staff will notify the applicant by electronic mail whether the application is incomplete and specify any missing information; otherwise, the application will be deemed complete.\n  * AREP applications will also be reviewed in accordance with applicable Policy Plan guidance. In accordance with state law, they may be disapproved if they propose installation of a new structure in an area of the county where all cable and public utility facilities are encouraged to be undergrounded as part of a transportation improvement project or a rezoning proceeding as set forth in the objectives contained in the Comprehensive Plan. A list of these areas is available upon request.\n\n\n\n## Required Documents\n\nAn application may require the following documents:\n\n**Property Identification Map:** Provide the official tax record and map for the subject property available online at Fairfax County's Real Estate Assessment site. \n\n**Proposed Facility / Site Plan** : Scale of 1\u201d= not more than 50\u2019.
